                "comment": "Once again the critics prove themselves as morons! This movie was definitely the best I've seen this summer and deserves a lot more recognition than it is getting. People see the name Michael Bay and instantly think of a sappy action movie not worth the time, but trust me, this one is definitely worth your time and money.I won't comment on specifics of the story because I don't want to spoil it, but as a whole it is very impressive, and tackles many issues that we face in today's society.The acting is great, and Ewan McGregor pulled off his character perfectly. The innocence and wonder that he expresses as Lincoln 6 Echo was the best I've seen from him.I'll admit that the first half of the movie is better than the 2nd half, and the many chase scenes can get frustrating, but the action adds a lot to the movie, and the directing is wonderful.But the one point that this movie tackled which makes it noteworthy is the characterization. I really cared for the two lead characters and wanted to see them succeed in their goal, which is rare in most action films. I even enjoyed seeing the minor characters through the movie, so much that I cared about their outcomes. Not to mention that they are believable. The main character in this film isn't some invulnerable super action hero, he is frail and inexperienced when it comes to fighting. There weren't any moments that I thought he was going out of his capabilities. The characters are confused and weak, and they are depicted wonderfully.Come on people, stop obsessing over the frat comedies, crappy comic-book adaptations, and dumb horror movies, and treat yourself to a good film. Don't pass this one up. GO AND SEE IT NOW!",

Oh. My. When we came out of it, my husband & I pretty much looked at each other and said \"What the h*ll is everyone complaining about? That movie rocked!\"We seriously loved it. Both of us agree that it's the best action movie we've seen all year. Maybe in two years. It was fantastic! The story was actually based on a premise we find plausible, the acting was good, the stars are gorgeous. Steve Buscemi was great, of course. There were funny moments without overplaying the jokes. There were some silly action sequences, but you know what? If I am having a good time, I am willing to believe that someone could fall 70 stories holding on to a piece of scaffolding, and somehow get caught in a net and not be injured. There was never a point where there were so many bullets flying around it was ridiculous that they hadn't been shot. No one flew through the air in slow motion. Sure, there was cheesy dialogue, but I don't go to a movie like this for the script, that's what Cameron Crowe movies are for. Also, the female lead was not a) too tough to be believed or b) all bimboed up with mass cleavage and tiny skirts. She was modestly dressed the whole time, and was competent without being over the top action hero girl. There was one sex scene, it fit with the plot, and was tastefully filmed. Seriously, I wish I understood why people don't like it. I thought it was bloody terrific. I've been in a good mood all day just because I had such a great time at the movies!I give it two paws up.",

                "comment": "Whoa! This movie made my Sunday evening, and weekend as a whole. I mean, it's not a magnum opus, maybe a little creepy when you come to think of the concept - but the characterization and acting by the leads was just brilliant! Everything was so well crafted that you will exit from the movie theater with a smile. Unless you're weirder than weird, of course.While watching the movie, so many questions arose - Why a Scotsman (McGregor) is made to speak with an American accent? Why is he paired with a lady (Johannsen) 10 years younger to him. Guess what - even these silliest of answers get answered in the end! PROLOGUE: This is not a SPOILER. It's an explanation of how things are before the time-line of the movie begins. The setting is 2019. People have gotten richer, of course technology has advanced drastically, and the concept of cloning does exist. Noted celebrities, politicians, sports-persons desire to live a longer life and a career no matter what has to be done. Thus, there are clones created in a remote institute in Arizona run by an English scientist ,Merrick. Merrick and his staff basically take a complete scan of the client (called the \"investor\") and a clone of the same investor is created with the same physical and anatomical, yet closer to perfect, features. However, these clones, or \"insurance policies\" as they are called, are bred to only be killed eventually for their spare parts - lungs, heart, you name it, to be taken away and given to the investor to live longer. Until their termination time, they are fed on a very strict diet, and are only educated up to the level of a 15 year old. The clones are kept content in their inner lives by being told they were brought to the institute because they were \"contaminated\" in the real world and were getting cured from the same. They were also promised a lottery where a winner gets to go to the \"Island\" - where a new world is set to begin, new breeding, no pollution, etc. This is until a flaw occurs in the habilitation process and one product, Lincoln has questions....----------------------------- Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen were absolutely brilliant in their acting and carried the movie from beginning to the end. I was slightly disappointed when I saw the trailer earlier, and it implied that Scarlett was becoming a blonde bimbo of Hollywood - but I was wrong. She not only had a role to play, but played it well. Hope she becomes the next Hollywood superstar as she is a truly good actress, and charming in her own way.McGregor, on the other hand, carries his post-Star_Wars grace very well, and should be looking for some really dramatic and challenging roles in the near future to get an Oscar or some awards. He is a good actor, and is definitely no James Bond material - too down to earth as an actor (maybe not as a person) to play the cocky British spy. The supporting cast - Michael Clarke Duncan only had a few lines to spare and was a cry baby, but an OK role done. Djimon Honsou - Hollywood's only \"African\" actor played his role well and gracefully. Steve Buscemi is what one could call a struggling actor. I respect him for trying something new like playing a confused ex-con on a full season of the SOPRANOS - showed his less-comedy side which he portrays in Adam Sandler movies. In the Island, he did sort of fit the role of a crazy techie, but he needs to find something that will bring his recognition back up.Sean Bean, the smooth talking, English villain who played a James Bond baddie too early in his career, also carried his vicious role well. Would have been more appropriate to see an American Southerner play the role of the institute's head-honcho as it was set in Arizona. Overall I gave the movie 8/10. I prefer it to Minority Report, and thank God it was not too hyped!",

A paradise for the lucky few lottery winners?While one may think this is a rip off on some sub part 70's B flick, I get the feeling this is a segway from Logan's Run, THX 1138 and others. The cast is good, the script is good ... along with the story (important) though some action scenes will stretch (and maybe break?) your belief, these transgressions are minor. All action movies have 'reality' issues.I suppose it is fashionable to bash Micheal Bay. I never really paid attention - but I guess, because of the Pearl Harbor disaster (the film with Ben Afleck, not the actual events from December 7th), people have a deep seated hatred for the director. This hatred is seemingly enhanced by the number of explosions that Bay uses in some of his movies.I think The Island (TI) got a bad rap for product placement. I think this is mostly undeserved. I did think the XBox (live people fighting) was badly placed... it just seemed silly, but other 'placements' seemed very natural - or even funny in a good way. And this leads to the car chase (or one of them). It was much better than the Matrix 2 car chase where all cars seemed to be of a new GM origin and the only cool car was the Camaro (also of GM origin, but at least it had SOME originality). Of course the ads in the movie theater can get annoying ... but that's nothing to do with the movie.I think Bay & Co did a very good job of setting the scene and showing us the human qualities of Jordan and Lincoln. In many ways they seemed more human than the others. Many big questions are raised by this movie and I think many statements are made about the human condition and what people will do to stay alive. How did Lincoln Six Echo develop memories from another person? What kind of influence did the tech/ McCord (played by Steve Buscemi) have on Lincoln. Merrick (Sean Bean) brings up this point, but I think his lack of a real answer makes a bigger statement than anything else.What is real and what is human? What is the nobility of the human spirit ... While these questions are different for everyone I think they are important and should have answers. This movie gives many answers and leaves the right questions.The dialog in TI is good, the actors are good, Scarlet is hot and did well with her role ... I've seen this once and I give it a 9 out of 10.I would go into this movie with as little knowledge about TI, as possible. I would ignore jaded reviewers (professionals who get PAID to review!) who get fussy at the oddest things. I would also ignore the 15 year old retards (is that redundant?) who fail understand that all these ideas are in the public domain and DIRECTORS do not plagiarize (unless they are writers!). I doubt any real 15 year old would get off the Island alive! Maybe the only smart ones are Lincoln & Jordan...MB did a good job. It has a nice build up and then the action is well paced with enough of the old to make the differences stand on their own.",

                "comment": "So Bay bashers are most likely to find little new to love here, despite the fact that this is a distinctly mature step up in his resume. Argue what you want, but it's hard to dismiss his work as not at least entertaining, if not more than occasionally quite absurd. You see ever dollar up on the screen and every shot looks like it was painstakingly produced (which has also been a regular source of ridicule as well as praise). Forget every other film he's made and let's get to this one.Far more intellectual than what you might expect, don't be surprised if your mind does not occasionally start to dwell on debates of morality and what makes a human being, well, a human being. There are harsh criticisms made about our society and our human nature to the point that you will find yourself demonizing most of the human characters and identifying with the pure, selfless and ideal nature of the protagonists. Our heroes are after all, basically children and therefore have an uncorrupted view of right and wrong, and act on those impulses accordingly. There are some very ugly reminders of what man has been capable in the service of his own selfish objectives, and man's capacity to rationalize the persecution or extermination of other humans and animals as either necessary or because the obstacles are less than human in their eyes. We are quite literally even reminded of the horrors of the Holocaust in a harrowing incinerator scene. We further have our our recall stimulated of another recent act of inhumanity when a major character speaks of a their parents part in resisting the warlords victimizing civilians in Africa. All pretty heavy stuff from the guy who directed the BAD BOY movies. Now, make no mistake, this is still Bay spectacle stuff here, but even much of that has the unique feeling of real and tangible. The cities seem functionaland one conceivable in the near future. There is not a lot of incomprehensible techno jargon to bombard you either. Even the chases, clearly inspired by other action films themselves (even Bay references himself here) seem fresh and clever. It's worth the ticket price. You get some real inner debate and creepy but intelligent suspense and some genuinely exciting chases in a believable futuristic world. If you take healthy doses of THX-1138, LOGAN'S RUN and a better realization of the B Movie FREEJACK (yeah, there's a bit of that movie in here too) and an obscure flick MST3K fans will recognize called CLONUS then you have a pretty good idea what to expect here, and you know what? It ain't bad at all.",

                "comment": "As a first-time outing without the overadrenalized Jerry Bruckheimer, 'The Island' comes off as a well considered project. While few of the ideas posited in this new film are 'new', Bay and screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have done a more than serviceable job of recycling ideas from other movies that arrived D.O.A.'The Island' is of course a remake of 'Parts:The Clonus Horror', one of the most sordid of D-grade Mystery-Science Theater 3000 candidates - 'Coma' made on a budget of $350,000. Straight-to-video? Straight-to-the-SciFi Channel? Not even close. Even Albert Pyun never managed to stink 'em up this bad - though he came close, many a time.But I'm supposed to be talking 'The Island' here, and not 'The Clonus Horror'. The Island' is a good movie, built on a solid script, excellent production values and sound performances delivered by A-list actors. As I sat in the theater watching this movie, I found myself going through a mental checklist, \"'Logan's Run', check. 'The Island of Dr. Moreau', check. 'Brave New World', check. 'Revenge of the Sith', check. There are even shades of 'Total Recall' and 'Gattaca' buried in here, as the film is a dystopia-buried-in-a-futuristic-consumer-fantasy kind of flick. The question remains, though - was this picture brought to fruition by Michael Bay, or just one of the higher-ups at Dreamworks SKG - SKG as in Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen.Ewan MacGregor redeems himself here, for the 6 years he spent trying to imitate Alec Guiness in the woebegone 'Star Wars' prequels. There's a wonderful long moment in the film where we're reminded he was once Scottish - 'Shallow Grave', 'Trainspotting' anyone? And OMG! Scarlett Johansson is actually a fairly attractive woman - I really couldn't tell before, with her abused girlfriend and serfdom turns in 'Lost In Translation' and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. Again, who knew? But the former Director Bay manages to shine through in some areas, with his signature explosions and oddballs in the supporting cast: Steve Buscemi, showing greater range than evidenced before, demeans himself once again, while Ethan 'Neelix' Philips shows up to disgrace himself as a roly-poly balding-on-top Stryker refugee.For shame! Is it possible to have a Michael Bay movie without cartoonish archetypes? Michael Mann got over it - I suggest that Bay get ahold of the manual and further his attempts at meaningful content. There may be something more memorable than 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor' in Bay's future. Let's hope that he's able to continue the evolution and that audiences can catch up.",

                "comment": "This \"film\" is full of non-stop product placements. The \"action\" scenes consist of a close up shot of, who knows what, with the camera shaking relentlessly. I must give Bay credit however, because it is obvious that he basically made up the whole movie himself as he went along. His visual style is incredible, if only he would stop cutting every millisecond. The cinematography, especially of Scarlett Johannsen is unbelievable. She looks candy-colored. The contrast of the film every time she is shown is amazing, and the natural lighting is a breath of fresh air. We can see shadows on their faces!There is no chance in hell there was ever a full script for this version of the movie. It seems as if Steve Buschemi's lines were the only ones that they bothered to write down on paper and the rest they made up. The pacing of the film is atrocious. Compare this to even the mediocre film \"Minority Report.\" At least that film got the viewer into the story with a great opening sequence. The only decent thing about this film is the pro-life and nature vs. nurture messages it forces you to think about in between boring scenes. Also, the white suits shot from above remind me of sperm, and many of the clones are shown in embryo like sacks, violently being cut upon. Much like abortion. The character \"motivations\" are absolutely laughable. Michael Bay should be ashamed at the way he uses black people in this film. In the extremely unfunny first act, black women and men are used to make \"funny\" sassy sarcastic jokes. After having a black villain, played by Djimon Hundsou chase down the two leads with black helicopters, fire at them with machine guns relentlessly, and lead groups of men in the process of destroying the city of los angeles, he suddenly becomes a \"good\" guy. He turns against his employers and decides to help liberate the clones.There is a character who seems to be an overacting Canadian actor hamming it up. He seems to be comic relief, but we all sat through his scenes stone faced. There is one scene where he enters a gas chamber, and panics. Needless to say, it was the best part of the movie. This character IS the movie. When you see him, you understand the tone and the mental age of the script. I remember being 10 years old. This movie was made for eight year olds.Overall, this film is a perfect example of how Hollywood can throw in a bunch of computer graphics and a horrible script and still wonder why they are losing money.",

                "comment": "I didn't believe Michael Bay could come back after making Pearl Harbor (the worst disappointment of my movie watching career)... and god, was I wrong.This movie is a perfect summer flick. It has action, a story that makes sense, high entertainment and... a babe ;-) More seriously, the story is amazing and the acting is pretty good.Many reviewers say that The Island is actually two movies stuck together - one, an exploration of a pretty dim universe and the second, a totally run of the mill action flick. I must agree with that. The first half is a very well made exercise in imagination and set design. The second part suffers from terminal Michael Bay-ism - way too many car chases, way too many explosions, way too many \"boooms, bangs and wowwwwwwws\".Contrary to many summer movies, The Island does NOT require a major suspension of disbelief: the story really makes sense. I'll try to see other movies written by the same team.The acting is very good. The two principals deliver as well in action scenes than in funny scenes (there are a few :-) Sean Bean plays a variation of his typical bad-guy role but he excels in it. Djimon Hounsou (the other Gladiator :-) is good but he has his ups and lows... Steve Buscemi is, as usual, a genius.The special effects are... too good? Micheal Bay seems to have mastered the art of milking too much money from producers - the car chases scenes are well made and are obviously expensive but they kinda distract from the story line. Personally, i would have removed a good half of them.I didn,t notice any major plot holes, besides the fact that the main characters are pretty indestructible... I wouldn't take life insurance on them, it would be a bad bet...There is a lot of product placement in this movie and, at one point, it gets laughable. Watch for a character to be using MSN Search in 2050... Please... Contrary to Minority Report, the cars of the future are not Japanese, there good ole' Cadillacs - I knew the US car industry would come back on top! ;-) Finally, I may buy the soundtrack... The background music is very effective.In summary - an excellent popcorn movie, by a director who delivers the goods.",

Director Michael Bay's hodgepodge futuristic sci-fi action thriller is a patchwork of previous genre plottings including \"THX-1138\", \"Blade Runner\", \"Logan's Run\", \"Gattaca\", \"Soylent Green\", \"The Sixth Day\", \"1984\" and \"Parts: The Clonus Horror\" (!) mixed with \"The Fugitive\" in this relentless cautionary tale about cloning with McGregor and Johansson as clones who discover their world has been one giant lie and decide to escape from their evil creator, Bean (hamming it up big time) to warn the real world about the tampering of humanity. The screenplay by Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci attempt to breathe fresh air into a tired sub genre \u0096 the sci-fi morality fable and totalitarian warning of a bleak future with middling results but Bay knows how to keep the pulse quicken with his trademark breakneck editing and pacing particularly in the film's climactic hairy car chase sequence that makes it worth the price of admission to see the carnage on a huge screen.

                "comment": "NOTE: Spoilers galore in this post.I was really disappointed with this movie. I was expecting a decent science fiction movie, instead I got a hacked up attempt at a sci-fi action/romance combination, with too many large nitpicks that it spoiled the experience.The story is pretty straight forward. A group of people live in isolation after being told that they are the survivors of some global catastrophe. They a mundane, but secure and physically fit life with promises that they will one day go to The Island, the last Utopian location on the planet. The main character, Lincoln-6-Echo, discovers the horrible truth; the people are in some kind of prison and everything they've been told is a lie. Eventually he escapes with Jordan-2-Delta and they discover that they are really clones of people in the \"real world\" that use the clones for body parts. They escape are on the run, then eventually return to free the other clones.The movie overall was good, it just had too many plot problem that just nagged on me enough to spoil the movie in general:1) The 2 fugitives escape from the compound with relative ease. Where is the security? How come they are able to walk down a long access bridge to freedom with NO ONE spotting them? They already fought security guards; no one is able to keep tabs on their position? 2) The main characters supposedly have the education of 15 year olds and they supposedly have almost NO knowledge of the \"real world\". Yet once they get to a train station and then to Los Angeles, they don't seem to have any problems getting around. I mean, they act stupid and don't know phrases like \"the can\", \"taking a dump\", \"dude\" and act incredulous around this. Yet they don't seem to have a problem navigating around a metropolis, which to them would be an alien environment. 3) The main characters get by with 5 movies worth of luck. They dodge trained military personnel. Survive drops from a skyscraper hundreds of feet in the air and manage to take out a helicopter while doing so. They are in a car when it gets totaled (cut in half!!) after getting side-swiped by an armored truck and walk away, not even dazed. I found it hard to empathize with the characters when they were in \"danger\" because they seemed to be invulnerable! 4) Clones with memories. This is a pet peeve of mine. Memories are NOT a part of a creatures DNA structure. A clone is simply a copy of a creatures physical make up. It cannot have the experience and memories of its donor, because the clone itself hasn't had those experiences or memories. Yet movies frequently portray a clone as not only having the same physical properties as a donor, but the same memories as well. Although, in this movie, the memories were mostly \"subconscious\". 5) When Jordan was brought back to the institution towards the end, NO ONE thought to search her for a weapon?!! 6) During some of the big action scenes (fighting with the guards while escaping and the big highway chase scene with the flying attack bikes) the camera kept shaking and it was hard to see what the heck was going on. Whats the point of seeing a movie, when the movie *itself* makes it difficult to see what is on the screen?!As the movie went on, these issues just keep accumulating until by the end, I just wanted to see the end.As a side note, I noticed that this movie was almost identical to merging together two other movies: Logans Run and Freejack. The movie has a man and a woman on the run, leaving an isolated society and encountering the world outside, only to return and \"free\" the people from the society (Logans Run). Meanwhile, they are on the run and hunted down by mercenaries, because their bodies are actually owned by some rich person (Freejack).Overall, I give the movie a 4 out of 10. I would give the movie a 7 out of 10 for just the story, but this is reduced for the annoying issues I mentioned previously.",

The task of picking a movie was assigned to me. But seeing that I haven't been catching up with movies listing for nearly 6 weeks, I found it a tough job. Summer really was deprived of attention-grabbing movie titles. My Chinese friends were turned off by the title of this flick itself, The Island. I mean, seriously, who would want to watch a movie called 'The Island', especially when they have no idea what is it all about in the first place? If it wasn't for the brief printed summary at the counter, I would not have given this movie a second glance. Like War of The Worlds, its poster was not self-explanatory. Plus, I did not watch the trailer prior to my trip to the cinema.BUT, unlike War of The Worlds (or any other movies before this), for once I did not question the logic of the flow of the storyline. The storyline was good enough for me to not stop focusing and start being a cynic. At the very least, questions that the average viewer might ask about the plot are answered. It was 100% NOT boring and the plot holes in this movie was subtle because of the relatively fast pace of the story growth. In fact, though I had only watched it once, I don't remember any noticeable loop holes in the storyline. Or questionable action scenes for that matter. I didn't cared if there were futuristic technologies in the movie. After all, the whole thing took place in the future. It was nice that it blended in with the contemporary definitions of the current world, all so that everything seemed viably realistic.Now, there is humor here and there, blended in nicely with action and drama. Noticeable humor genres are satire, sarcasm and banter. The director, Micheal Bay, cleverly played with \"human\" innocence in the movie. The whole innocence thing somehow reminded me of how complex our minds have made today to be. How open the minds of those \"humans\" are to different ideas, compared to many of us in reality. Lincoln Six Echo questioned, and that was what made the difference. That manner reminded me of Dead Poets Society, another good movie.Needless to say, Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson complemented each other well. This is the first time I watched Johansson in action, and I must say, her character development as Jordan Two Delta was good. It was more noticeable than McGregor's part. Lincoln Six Echo was depicted as a skeptic to start with, whereas Jordan Two Delta was very innocent. On the other hand, I was quite surprised that McGregor took up this role as I was quite brainwashed with his role as Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars and Catcher Block in Down With Love. After all, Lincoln Six Echo is more of a character of innocence, curiosity, and mischief, just like a confused child. Nevertheless, it was a refreshing brilliant performance of McGregor.If I were to complain about anything at all, it would be that I didn't manage to buy popcorn because of the long line at the food counter. I don't think people who are just looking for entertainment with depth would complain about this movie.In conclusion, I definitely want to watch this again.",

I would love to read the original.

During the car chase I was thinking, \"god do I have to laundry, when will I actually get to do it.\" A good flick will not let your mind drift. It will present questions for the viewer and stick with you through the next day. After the this flick we reviewed it at subway, getting dinner and soon dismissed it.

In a world facing ethical decisions involving human embryo research, the film's message that, however created, human beings are human beings, is powerfully communicated.Parental warning: This film contains extremely violent scenes, almost all necessary for the communication of the message of the movie, but disturbing - even, in the case of a young mother and of Michael Clarke Duncan's character, heartbreaking. This film is NOT for children.",

It stars two of the better actors/actresses of our time in Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlette Johanssen and gives us an amount of action that can make most fans smile. At the same time the story line is actively involving yet not complicated in any sense of the imagination. Michael Bay finally came through in his greatest movie to date yet this movie only pulled in 12 million dollars on it's opening weekend. It is a disgrace to see such movies as Wedding Crashers outperform the Island this past weekend. That tells me that people are more interested in watching two horny full grown men invade a wedding to get some over a movie where there is a great story with depth involved. I would talk about the movie and some of the amazing sequences but to do that would ruin the movie for many viewers. Just know that the movie is set in the future and the technological advancements the movie shows us are outstanding. The special effects are top of the line as most Michael Bay movies seem to be. It seems to me that The Island is either going to completely bomb at the box office (which it shouldn't) or will become a hit because of word of mouth. What will surprise most people if they take the time to see this movie is it does not completely revolve around gigantic explosions or sex. Instead this movie focuses on the life of two people and their fight for survival in a world that we would not even be able to comprehend if we had to experience it ourselves. All I am saying is look at the bulk of the reviews for this movie. Most people have given it a rating of seven or higher meaning it is a very good movie to say the very least. If you spend eighteen dollars to see this movie with your significant other you will not feel like you were cheated out of your money. Instead when you leave you will wonder what it would be like to live in a world that these two people have to experience.",

Scarlett Johansen and Euwene MacGregor are excellent as clones who have lived in an enclosed city with the promise of an ultimate trip to \"The Island.\" This is supposed to be the ultimate reward for their service and those that get chosen to go, do so via a lottery.MacGregor starts to get haunted by a dream where he is on a boat and being drowned. He tells this dream to the city doctor who appears to be more than intrigued by it, in fact he has a mechanical table violently take hold of MacGregor and inject robot mini probes into the sides of his eyes.MacGregor's curiosity makes him start to question everything and it is sparked more by a maintenance man (Steve Busemi) who lives outside the enclosed city. (The people are told that the outside was contaminated from a great catastrophe). This curiosity continues to increase when he finds a rather large insect. MacGregor starts to learn the real truth behind the \"lottery\" and save his lady friend (Johansen) who has won the lottery and is scheduled to go to the supposed island.The rest of the movie plays out like a super high tech version of Logan's Run. The special effects are amazing especially the futuristic Los Angeles. Even though you can kind of figure what will happen, the movie is compelling mostly due to the excellent acting of the two stars.",

                "comment": "I really liked this film. First a comment on the acting: Ewen McGregor - SO nice to see he won't get type-cast, since he does many different films. He's a great actor and shows at least 2 sides of his wide spectrum of character. He didn't seem to have one awkward acting moment in this movie. He helped make it great.Scarlett Johansen - She has really blossomed and bloomed (or whatever) into a beautiful and talented and enjoyable actress with more depth than you might, at first, imagine. She was able to aptly harness the traits of someone who's both naive and savvy at the same time. Plus she's gorgeous and her facial expressions say it all.Steve Buscemi - Yet another fine performance, Steve! You never disappoint.Djimon Hounsou - Stepping out of his 'normal' roles nicely. First began to see it in Constantine and it's nice to see him in a role that doesn't necessarily HAVE to call for an African. He's a great talented actor and well deserves this role variation. He's more than paid his dues to Hollywood. Not that he shouldn't do roles that call for a strong 'guide'-type role in Africa, as well.Sean Bean - Did a great job in this film too. Like Hounsou, he seems to do a fine job in every movie he's in. It'd be nice to see him do a different type of character. Nonetheless, was perfect for the role he played in this movie.Direction: The scenes and camera angles shot for a particular emotion was covered very professionally. The acting talent was expertly enhanced by really good direction in this film. I have scenes that I didn't like in this film (albeit some were very unbelievable, but in an enjoyable way).SPOILERS!!!! The scene falling from that building, riding a large sign (letter 'R') was very far-fetched by very thrilling. However, the \"Jesus really loves you!\" comment was extremely hilarious.I also loved the scene where Scarlett Johansen was watching her 'sponsor' on that commercial for Calvin Klein and watching 'herself' kissing someone, having never experienced that for herself. Then the way she touched her own lips. It was a very special moment in that film.",

A couple of fantastic car-action scenes are in this movie but they should be not. This is not BadBoys II, it looks more similar to Artificial Iintelligence. Ewan Mc Gregor is a good actor but he is not the right one. Scarlett Johanson looks like a potato on the screen and she is the real flow of this movie. While I was reading E.W. I suddenly saw a picture of Scarlet in her white pajama with her only empty expression on her face and I immediately understood that this movie will be a flop.Costumes are pathetic and the costume designer should be hanged up.

                "comment": "What would you do to survive? How much would you be willing to pay for a longer life? These are the issues at hand in Michael Bay's latest film, easily one of his better efforts (and helped by the absence of blockbuster king Jerry Bruckheimer, if only a little). The world Bay has created looks real. The action doesn't always. But he's brought an excellent cast on board to help the movie on its way.Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) has lived underground for three years. He's something of a rebel in a nearly perfect society, one of two remaining sanctuaries from the contamination that has killed almost everything outside. That other sanctuary is the Island, a \"Garden of Eden\" that everyone hopes to go to, by winning the lottery. Lincoln's best friend is Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johanssen), who is a more obedient member of their society, who likes to show Lincoln up in a virtual fighting game powered by XBOX (the advertising is everywhere). Only Lincoln asks questions, like where does the food go that he and his friend Jones Three-Echo make every day? The only clues he can find come from a white-trash maintenance guy, McCord (Steve Buscemi), who works in the outer, more contaminated area of the society. Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) worries about Lincoln's queries.When Jordan wins the lottery to go to the Island, Lincoln has another of his bad dreams, only slightly different from before. He gets up in the middle of the night and slips into a restricted area, disguised as a doctor, where he makes a very disturbing discovery. Two of the citizens at Merrick were sent to the island. One, a lottery winner named Starkweather (Michael Clarke Duncan, a happy version of John Coffey), and Lima, a pregnant woman whose water just broke. Lima has been euthanized while her baby was delivered to another woman who looks just like her, and Starkweather is seen running down the hall with a surgical cut down the center of his chest.Of course, as anyone who knows anything about this movie would know, Lincoln tells Jordan and they make an escape, pursued by a French mercenary (Djimon Hounsou, delectably amoral) and his cold-blooded cohorts. Merrick explains to Hounsou's Albert Laurent the importance of getting Jordan, since model Sarah Jordan is comatose in a New York hospital. The two find Lincoln's old buddy McCord at a biker bar, where they learn they've got a lot to learn about the outside world. Says Lincoln: \"I've gotta go get McCord. He's in a can taking a dump,\" having absolutely no idea what that actually means. McCord sets them straight on who they really are, that they are actually clones of millionaires, and tries to get them on a train to L.A., where Lincoln's \"sponsor\" lives.L.A., 2019 looks remarkably realistic. It's a believable future because the cars look almost the same, yet elevated trains keep going up and up and up, mercenaries fly around on hoverbikes, and cars have a finger-print identification system. Laurent and his cronies are following the \"stolen\" credit card McCord, now dead, gave to Lincoln. A series of shoot-outs occur between Laurent's guys and police, Laurent's guys and civilians, and especially, Laurent's guys and the two clones. The best scene during this is when our two heroes are riding on the back of a tractor trailer hauling train wheels, and untie them, sending them rolling along and into their pursuers' vehicles. Another scene, that was too hard to believe, was when the clones are hanging on the insignia of an office building, and fall ninety stories to still survive. \"Jesus must REALLY love you,\" says a construction worker and witness to them, upon their miraculous survival.More fun and excitement follows with the face-to-face confrontation of Lincoln Six-Echo with Tom Lincoln, a Scottish boat designer who is much more fun to watch, even if he's not the good guy the clone is.McGregor, as both insurance and sponsor, is quite good. His American accent is actually better than the trailer would have me believe, and his sense of wonder is quite believable, as long as Bay remembers it, so too does his egocentric persona as the Scottish bad boy. (Since Lincoln's false memories are actually the memories of his sponsor, he is all the more believable) Johanssen, as the educated-to-fifteen-years Jordan expresses a sense of curiosity at the verge of maturity maintains a borderline childlike point of view at all times (except in bed, something \"Newsweek\" critic David Anson brought up with Bay in an interview). Sean Bean is marvelous as yet another of his many villains, this one being a scientist with a God-complex who never quite grasps the absolute amorality of his work. Hounsou is brutal and intimidating, and a last-minute change of heart is exactly the kind of thing that, for some reason, never seems to work in movies - he's too bad to be good. Buscemi once again helps to round out the movie as a human foil, full of humor and a cynical look at things. Linclon: \"What's God?\" McCord: \"Well, you know when you wish for something? God's the one that ignores you.\"",

Maybe not the whole Clone concept, but the time/date and feel of the film.The main story is a Scientist has created a living organism, with given the correct DNA, could be cloned like any other regular person. The \"clients\" pay big bucks to have clones made of them. Why you say?. Well it's simple if something happens to you in the real world like a failed liver. Then you just get your Clones Liver as a replacement. Since it is the same as you in every way, there would be no body issue's with it.The Scientist calms to it's clients that the organism do feel, and have no life, but later on they found that if the organism didn't have a life the organs would fail. So secretly underground they kept the clones living in this head quarters.The clones are lead to believe that the world outside these walls is all destroy, and they are the survivors. There is one place where it is OK to live outside in the real world, called \"The Island\". All the clones are lead to believe that the Island is a place where you can live like a real human, in Paradise. The Truth is that the clones don't know about is that their is no Island and when someone wins to go to the Island it means that their human counter part needs their organs to live. The clones lead to believe they'll be getting Paradise are killed for organs.The whole movie is based around a Scientist trying to play god. Great Movie i really enjoyed it 10 out of 10",

                "comment": "A refreshing, tency bit clich\u00e9d, fun, sci-fi, action thriller!! This is definitely one of the best action movies I have seen in a while!! Not the most original (has aspects of Matrix, and other important sci fi and action films) but good enough. The concept was quite interesting, there are people being held inside an area because of a planetary contamination. They are made to follow strict rules concerning dress code, sleeping patterns, eating habits, and interaction with others. Every once in a while a new survivor of the contamination shows up. These people look forward to one thing, and that is the Island, the last uncontaminated place on earth, and every day or so another person gets picked to leave and go to the Island. Lincoln Six Echo has questioned these practices and by roaming through the sphincters realizes that there is no ISland and everyone who supposedly goes there gets killed or goes through deadly surgery. Needing to save his friend, Jordan Two Delta who is next to go to the Island, they make an escape and realize that they are clones of people who pay millions of dollars to have them made. Little do these payers know that the clones actually have feelings! Jordan and Lincoln go on a wild goose chase with lots of bash em up fun action, with time for a sex scene in there (the clones are programmed not to have a strong sex drive-thats why it's there first time). Lincoln meets the person that he is a clone of, and Jordan sees pictures because she is a model. With help of some other people the clones are set free in the end!! The acting is pretty believable for an action flick, I mean how can you go wrong with Scarlett Johannson and Ewan McGregor. The cinematography is eye candy too. The only two problems I have with this movie is that it runs a bit long (a little over two hours), they could have easily edited out about 10-15 minutes of it. And, it takes place in 2019, which is hard for me to believe. Overall, this is a compelling, fun, and good movie- I would definitely suggest seeing it on the large screen! 9/10",

Bay is completely capable of making a summer action film without the Bruckheimer stamp.The film itself has a Logan's Run/THX-1138 vibe to it that may work for some and may not work for others. I, myself, liked it very much. It adds to the whole concept of clones being created to supply body parts for when the client needs it.Ewan McGregor delivers another amazing performance. He plays Lincoln, the hero of the film. His \"best friend\" is played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. While the film delivers in its action sequences and interesting storyline, the flaw is in the romance. The clones are denied sexual contact and when McGregor and Johansson escape they begin to discover their sexual arousals. This portion of the film should have probably been explored more. Nonetheless, the film is a popcorn film and I feel its a good one. If you liked Bad Boys and The Rock you'll dig this film.RATING: 3 STARS (***)",

The Idea about clones being used for \"spare parts\" is an all too real possibility in the near future. Though the film greatly touches on the negative aspects of cloning, it also somehow almost justifies it.Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson pull off their roles as clones perfectly. Their roles, which require them to act almost like innocent children, yet behave like adults, create an unfathomable connection with the audience. When watching this movie, I cannot help but think back to the days of my childhood, back when my mind was simple and curious, and not corrupted by society like I shamefully admit today.Scarlet Johansson's character Jordan is the perfect woman in my eye. I would also assume that many women today would consider Ewan McGregor's character Lincoln the perfect man. For you religious nuts out there, these two can be compared to Adam and Eve, as they both are innocent, beautiful, and very curious.Though I assume most of you already know the basic plot, as the previews show quite a bit, I will still cut myself short, as I do not want to give anything away.

Strangely, The Island supposedly isn't a remake of Clonus, which means a lawsuit is likely. I'm generally skeptical of plagiarism suits in Hollywood--everything has already been done and there aren't any truly original stories left to tell, but in the case of The Island the thievery of Clonus is so blatant that the people who claim this is an \"original story\" deserve whatever they get. How is it possible that The Island got approved and filmed and marketed and released without a single involved party noticing that their movie bore a troubling resemblance to another film that was previously released theatrically, shown on television (and ridiculed on MST3000) and even released on DVD? Didn't people who make 120 million dollar Hollywood B movies watch B movies themselves as kids? Well, somebody involved with the story and script for The Island clearly did, because the similarities between The Island and The Clonus Horror are too great to be a coincidence.Of course, that doesn't address whether The Island is actually any good. Clonus had a clever premise but lacked the budget and talent to pull it off. The Island has all the money and talent anyone could hope for, but as a movie it really isn't any better.The problem is that while the premise is perfect for a provocative and intelligent thriller, the director is Michael Bay of Armageddon and Bad Boys 2 fame. Bay doesn't make intelligent or provocative thrillers. He makes mindless big-budget crap where stuff gets blown up. Lots and lots of stuff.The Island starts off great, even if the early scenes feel like they've been largely lifted from the earlier film, but as soon as the action leaves the confines of the facility where the clones live and enters the outside world the action scenes kick in and the movie gets dopier and dopier, leading to a happy ending so cringe inducingly awful you just know Steven Spielberg had to have a hand in this somewhere. Who wants to bet that if Spielberg had produced or directed Armageddon Bruce Willis would have somehow gotten off the asteroid alive? Spielberg could never resist a tearful reunion between Willis and his daughter. The botched endings to Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Minority Report provide all the proof anyone could need. The ending for The Island isn't just bad, it's Spielberg bad, it's the kind of happy ending that ignores all of darker implications of what came before for superficially uplifting images that make little narrative sense and completely insult the intelligence of the audience.In the case of The Island we have one character who spends the entire film causing mayhem and killing innocent people changing sides (that's going to make me forget all about the civilians and police he and his men killed in pursuit of the clones) while the clones themselves escape to freedom at the top of a mountain. End credits. Hurray. Everyone leaves happy. No wait, the cold-blooded mercenary looks at the clones escaping to freedom and smiles, suppressing a tear in his eye. Now everyone leaves happy. (Unless like me you leave nauseous).Of course, none of the clones knows anything about the real world and it would be interesting to find out how the world reacts to the news of what was going on in the lab, particularly since the clones are all of people who are rich and influential, including the president. Would there be a scandal? Would the government cover everything up? Would the government hunt down the clones or leave them be? Would the clones try to find their sponsors or take over their sponsors lives since they are identical and have many of the same memories? There are so many interesting directions that The Island could have gone in, the fact that it ultimately turns into a mindless explosion fest is more disappointing than usual. Bad Boys 2 never really had the potential to be anything other than what it was, a mindless big-budget action comedy destined to make money but be forgotten as soon as it left theaters, but The Island could have been a classic. Instead it just feels like another Michael Bay movie.",

I think director Martin Scorsese did an amazing job of showcasing Howard Hughes life as a Hollywood filmmaker and Aviation pioneer. Every once in a while during the viewing of this film I felt as if I hadn't really accomplished anything in life. Hughes lived such a fascinating life compared to that of an average Joe. It is really kind of sad that his phobias got the best of him and he spend the final two decades of his life in isolation. Who knows what he could have accomplished.As for the performances, they were all amazing. I have never really been a fan of Leo, but I was really impressed with his performance. It was amazing. And the technical team was as impressive. The production design, costumes, cinematography, editing, etc, were all at top level.

THere just wasn't anything there to keep me entertained.Leo's portrayal of Howard Hues the germophobic, womanizing, obsessive compulsive, maniac, was just as any of his movies...

I've never felt happier to see a character dying in a film. And yet... he lives! Kate Beckinsale, a woman whom I admire in Hollywood, had the most annoying and pointless part in the film. She seems to be the \"fallback\" girl for Hues, who he wants to marry, just because, brings him down into nothingness, and then drags him back up because she feels sorry for him. She sort of has a \"woman of the evening\" feeling about her.You are also not spared in this movie, pointless nudity, which is to say that we see quite a bit of a naked Leo, who is afraid of the germs on his clothes 3/4 of the way into the film. It was pointless! All in all, it was difficult to stay in the room while this movie was playing. It's ending didn't play out, and I just have the feeling that I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life.",

There's definite promise in the early scenes where the young Hughes comes across as a sleazeball with the nightclub waitress and you wonder how this particular shade of character will be reconciled with all the other shades still to be painted in. But then. . . there aren't any more. The script abandons any notion of complexity and instead drops into neutral, leaving all concerned to do their best with an acting vehicle that never once gets off the ground.Scorsese is too canny a director not to know when things aren't working out, but there's real desperation here in the extended aircraft crash sequence, as blatant a case as ever there was of special effects being rushed in to enliven a movie that's lost its way as well as its pace.Shame. It could, and should, have been so much, much better.",

My prejudice is based on a personal bias against the Star, the person (Hughes) represented, the State where our man was born, and the Director. Armed with this sort of informed doubt, I am seldom burdened with a dud movie. We have a large collection of DVD releases, a small house, and limited storage space. Any addition to the collection has to be good enough to bump some earlier selection out to the Thrift Store shelves. In other words, to earn a place on our shelf, a film has to be a convincing WINNER and BETTER than something else already there. So, it was with misgivings that I agreed to sit through \"The Aviator\". So, I did. My wife loved it (or, the Kate Hepburn part). I hated it, all of it.It would have been sufficient for the director to simply state that \"HH\" inherited much more money than he deserved and got on with the business of playing with it. And, with anything else that came his way. The ending could have come next but that was somewhere in the muddle (er, middle) just before \"HH\" leaped out of bed and raced to the Government Hearings to protect his good name. Our man was really upset when he divined somehow that he was not believed and that made him a liar! (\"...I am not, nor I have been, A LIAR!...\") Hmm, reminds me of Nixon telling us he was not a crook. Onward.(In fairness, \"HH\" was quoted as saying that other companies had signed contracts to deliver defensive weapons that became obsolete with the end of World War II. Furthermore, those companies had not delivered unwanted weapons. How short sighted he was - we still see some of those aircraft flying around to this day. We could use some more of them, too. Forest fires, don't you know?) Well, \"HH\" hocked the farm to get TWA (Teeny Weenie Airlines?) off the ground. This was interesting. It seems that there really was a bad guy after all. The U.S. Government. NO! That was Juan Trippe, president of Pan American Airways. All that fellow wanted was a monopoly of passenger business everywhere. Sheese! Another Henry Ford/John Rockefeller. \"HH\" resented that fellow.I grew up about 3 miles from the Hughes Aircraft factory over near Loyola College; I heard about the \"Spruce Goose\" but never had a glimpse of it - did not see it moved by truck - did not see it taxi and do wind sprints out in the Harbor - Saw the huge hangar where it sat for decades. I never even got into the geodesic tomb built for it in later years. - Just heard a lot about it. I do remember that \"HH\" and a crew of dozens (3 to 5 per engine) drove it out into the Harbor and ran it back and forth and that he actually lifted it out of the water for a short run. Local press derided him for not getting it up further - we were all disappointed. Not in the movie, however. There he gooooooooeeeeesssssss!!!!!! Yay! I finally caught up with it in McMinnville, Oregon in 1995. It was sitting in a parking lot, not assembled yet. Phooey. (\"HH\" also built a huge helicopter for some reason.) Where were we? Oh yes, \"The Aviator\". The special scenes showing the crash of the TurboProp showed the right wing slicing through the wall of a house that must have been a thousand feet long and all built from rice paper. Yes, \"HH\" was lucky. And obnoxious. The film did nothing to correct our impressions of him. As it turned out, \"HH\" was just another shark in the Hollywood Pool. At least his aircraft were interesting.",

It's a solid movie because of the life of Howard Hughes itself. The story of Howard Hughes is not his mental illness, nor his affair with Kathryn Hepburn, nor his run-in with Congress. Rather the story of Howard Hughes is about what Hughes did, what he built, what he accomplished, what an incredibly great and gifted man he was. He was rich man, but he was also a worker, a test pilot, a builder, an innovator, an inventor, as well as a pioneer Hollywood producer and director. No matter how hard this movie tries to portray Mr. Hughes as some kind of oddball, and no matter how unbelievable and superficial is Mr. Di Caprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes, the man's accomplishments could not be ignored or denigrated, even in this movie, and they speak for themselves. So Howard Hughes had mental problems? So what? What is important is what Howard Hughes did, and for that reason this movie should be watched.",

Might also have persuaded him to hire someone more convincing than Gwen Stefani for the role too, but I digress. Plus points: looks great, though often in a curiously indulgent way (blowing the effects budget on Hughes near-fatal crash for example). Some fine performances, notably Cate Blanchett doing a star turn as Katherine Hepburn, the only impersonation which really convinces (Kate Beckinsale manages to look like neither Ava Gardner nor Kate Beckinsale). Leonardo DiCaprio acts his socks off but to no avail - it's that chubby kid again, pretending to be Howard Hughes this time. Disbelief never suspended, but it's a casting fault, not his. Big negatives: it's so damn boring. It seems to go on for ever. It's very old fashioned, being more concerned with chronology and events than really putting work into the connecting themes. Had Scorsese had concentrated on one relationship - maybe the Hughes/ Hepburn thing, which had some really fine, delicate moments - and built a smaller film around that - maybe with a grown-up playing Hughes - it could have been way better, but I guess he's not that kind of director. I kept thinking of that Jonathan Demme movie, 'Howard and Melvin', where Jason Robards' Hughes is only on screen for a few moments yet resonates through the film (and continues to do so afterwards) in a way that diCaprio never does here. To quote Aimee Mann, and like Hughes own colossally expensive yet largely forgotten 'Hell's Angels', what a waste of gunpowder and sky....",

Another matter is to watch it and I must say that even though the movie does have stunning sequences and you can tell that everything in the flying sequences was well researched, it does leave you rather unfulfilled at the end. The trouble begins, as it usually does with the performances of the actors. Leonardo DiCaprio does well in the opening sequences and in one particular scene (the premiere of Hell's Angels) he captures just about every aspect of his character which unfortunately will be overemphasized through the rest of the movie. Like another of Scorsese's favorites, De Niro, he is pretty much let loose to bring out every emotion that he has in order to make the character a human being, rather than a stereotype.The supporting cast are not so lucky and I must say that even though Cate Blanchett is very good indeed as Katherine Hepburn, she hardly deserved the Oscar for her performance here. Her one great moment is when she and Dicaprio visits her family and they play a game of one-up-man-ship but that is more a collaborative effort.Another supporting actor nominee, Alan Alda, is serviceable as the slimy senator on the take from Alec Baldwin. His scene with Dicaprio at the hotel lunch meeting is some of the best acting he has ever done, despite the fact that it is rather superfluous because it is merely a set up for the big Senate hearing. The third actor worth mentioning is John C. Reilly who is in nearly every major American film today. Here he gets to play a normal character for once but he is terribly wasted. We don't feel that he is all that important neither to Hughes or the film.So to repeat what I said earlier: The story of Hughes is fascinating but like so many biopics it is not completely up to par with the real story. I think the opening caption on this film says it all: \"Based on a true story\" and not \"The full story\".",

Here is the creator of Dog Day Afternoon and Wise Guys, a man considered one of the best of the 1970's Golden Age of Film, but film by film his stuff gets more over produced, less insightful, and more expensive. I saw it coming with Gangs of New York, but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy. They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive, good-looking bore without a soul.In a documentary on Neo-Realism, Italian Post War Cinema, Scorsese claims he started with storyboards as a child, a comic book look that is produced giving the director a visualization of what the film will look like. The trouble with The Aviator, it looks like a storyboard. The replicas and animation of Hugh's weird airplanes almost steal the show, because they are the only interesting thing to look at on screen. Howard Hughes is never fleshed out. At least Kinsey, a recent bio flick tried to show why Kinsey was what he was, but DiCaprio's Hugh's is some kind of freak because his mother talked about diseases while he bathed. There's not enough there Martin. The bulk of the film shows a very young actor with no physical resemblance to Howard Hughes talking big time business and avionics without any back-story on how he became so brilliant out of the crib? The women in Hugh's life are trotted out one by one. He's a cocky guy putting his hand under a cigarette flappers skirt, a rich boy lover for Kathryn Hepburn (She doesn't come off too swell in this version), and Ava Gardner (No wonder Sinatra and Artie Shaw had it easy with this chick after the money-bags geekdom of Hughes).

I am not a big fan of DiCaprio, but I have to say hats of to the guy, this was an excellent performance.There seems to be a lot of talk about the character of Hughes as not being likable, and perhaps this is not the best way to make people like the film. I have to disagree, this is a commentary on a major figure in aviation history. What would be the point in making a film about him and changing him so that he was more likable? By all accounts he was a man driven incessantly by a desire to succeed, to go one step further in aviation. DiCaprio captured this about the man completely. Of course as most truly driven people are, he made enemies and some people simply found him too much. He would have not been an easy man to be around, even when his psychological problems were not affecting him. If the character had been softened to make him easier to like, then it would not have been a film about Howard Hughes.Nevertheless as the film progresses there is clearly a sense of loyalty toward the man from the growing population of people who work for him, he is clearly looked up to and there is the desire of his closest colleagues and friends to keep his problems out of the headlines, to protect him from pressure and harm. Even though he may not have been the easiest man to like, it is clear that he was liked by a great many people.Cate Blanchett was just perfect as Kathryn Hepburn as was Kate Bekinsale as Ava Gardener, and the insight into 1920-40 Hollywood was interesting.In my opinion, Alec Baldwin had the weakest character although I would not go so far as to say he did a bad job of portraying the bad guy of Pan American. Alan Alda (as always) provided a much better \"bad guy\" though in the form of the Senator whose \"witch hunt\" enquiry was torn apart by a determined Hughes.I quite enjoy long films, but this is longer than most. There are not many films this long that I would want to watch many times, but I think I will be watching this again soon as I was engrossed in the story from beginning to end. It's a shame that film is only concerned with Hughes life up till the maiden (and only) flight of the Hurcules, but if his whole life had been handled then in my opinion it would have seemed a very rushed and crowded film.Recommended.",

His acting is not particularly bad, it is just awfully boringly obvious. No depth, no complexity, no ambiguity. He looks angry when he has to be angry, sound megalomaniac when he has to be megalomaniac... nothing more. Besides, Hughes was certainly a ladies'man, but one can't say that the affairs with Kate Hepburn or Ava Gardner are really interesting (and, most of all, DiCaprio never seems really interested in any of them).Admittedly, a biopic is a difficult exercise, and few of them are what you may call masterpieces.

A 170 minute film that kept me interested throughout the whole thing. Its a great biopic about Howard Hughes and the obstacles he encountered while making great advancements in aviation and making a few films as well. Scorsese's direction is brilliant, i love the mood and feel of this film. Great job again by my favorite director. The screenplay is very interesting, at times very funny and great drama, John Logan (of Last Samurai, Gladiator fame) does a good job here. The cast is also good, Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, he is better than Gangs of New York which i previously believed to be his best performance along with What's eating gilbert grape. Cate Blanchett shines as the leading lady, great to see her working with scorsese. The supporting cast is great as well, kate beckinsale was believable and good as ava gardner a few steps up from her poor acting in pearl harbor. Adam Scott was also good in this film. John C. Reily, Alan Alda and Ian Holm all gave great supporting performances as well. The film has a great score by Howard Shore, and great cinematography by a very talented Robert Richardson (Bringing out the dead, u-turn, casino), this guy has filmed some of my favorite films, great cinematography in aviator as well. There was nothing i didn't like about this film, I mean i usually am critical of Scorsese, but i don't see why people bash his later efforts, his past 3 films are all personal favorites of mine and although they don't rank as high as Taxi Driver, Casino, and Goodfellas in my favorite film list, they are still up there.

THE AVIATOR proves Aristotle's point.Here's a movie that takes a lot of really interesting people and makes them -- not very interesting. The weakness is mainly the superficial script, which covers Hughes the aviation pioneer (much of this is quite exciting), Hughes the Hollywood producer (this is sketchy and disjointed), Hughes the womanizer (sketchy and uninvolving), and Hughes the obsessive-compulsive eccentric -- but never quite succeeds in pulling all these elements into a persuasive whole.At the end of this very, very long film, I didn't really *feel* anything about Hughes, either positive or negative. He seems as cold and remote at the end as at the beginning and the last hour drags.What Scorcese needed was a screenplay that would make us care about Hughes -- either love him or hate him -- the way CITIZEN KANE does. But THE AVIATOR is no KANE. It tries to cover too much, and you never really know why some things were included and others omitted; the result is the incidents covered seem shallow, obvious, and quickly glossed-over.Still, there are a number of excellent scenes in the film. My favorite is Hughes' visit to Katherine Hepburn's family, where her relations -- as headstrong and self-involved as she is -- treat him with hilarious rudeness.I should confess I have a problem with DiCaprio: I have trouble accepting him as a grown-up. He always seems to me like a 14 year-old boy playing an adult in a junior High School play. He's a pretty good actor; he applies himself and he's quite talented. I don't know why that boyish thing bothers me, just as it did in TITANIC, where Kate Winslett seemed more like his aunt than his lover.Even Scorcese's period mise en scene fails to persuade. The sets and costumes are all so colorful, so squeaky-clean, they seem made for a musical comedy rather than a serious period drama. And Scorcese makes too many obvious choices, such as the movie Hughes watches that convinces him the public now wants sound films. Of course it's THE JAZZ SINGER.As in NEW YORK, NEW YORK, there's a ton of painstaking period detail, but it doesn't ring true. You don't feel you're really in the 1930s and 40s, any more than you believe Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Cate Blanchett tries a little too hard as Katherine Hepburn, though it's basically an intelligent and effective performance. Her strenuous efforts to imitate Hepburn's well-known vocal mannerisms are distracting at times.So I can see why THE AVIATOR lit no fires either at the box office or at the Oscars. A huge amount of work and money went into a film that is frequently interesting, but finally not all that compelling.",

In the scene where he goes wacko in his screening room, I didn't know if that was days, weeks, or months, or whether he's still holed up there today.

                "comment": "It ain't always easy being a visionary and an innovative genius - just ask Howard Hughes, the renowned millionaire, who had three main ambitions in life: to build the fastest airplanes, to make the biggest movies, and to become the richest man in the world. That he achieved those lofty goals at a very great personal cost to himself is what makes his story the stuff of legend. For Hughes also suffered from the demon of mental illness, which manifested itself in chronic obsessive/compulsive behavior, a neurotic fear of germs, and acute paranoia. Martin Scorsese captures all facets of this larger-than-life figure in \"The Aviator,\" a high-flying epic that does justice to a man who became a national icon and the embodiment of the American dream despite his internal weaknesses - and whose legend lives on today.John Logan's script spends virtually no time on Hughes' youth except for a brief prologue which shows Howard's hypochondriac mother planting those seeds of fear in his tender psyche that would haunt him the rest of his life. The story proper begins with Hughes' efforts to produce what would turn out to be the most expensive film ever made up to that time, the war epic \"Hell's Angels,\" a non-studio work that allowed Hughes to combine his twin loves of movie-making and aviation. If nothing else, Hughes thought BIG, and his capriciousness and profligacy, as reflected in the mounting budget of the film he was making, also spilled over into the realm of aviation, as he began looking for ways to create ever more aerodynamic airplanes at greater and greater cost. His obsession with size culminated in the creation of the ill-fated Spruce Goose, the largest airplane ever made - and one whose airborne career lasted exactly one flight.Logan and Scorcese also focus on the personal side of Hughes' life, concentrating specifically on his tumultuous affairs with Katharine Hepburn (brilliantly played by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). His relationship with Hepburn is a particularly telling one because they seem to understand one another so well - so well, in fact, that they are unable to make a permanent go of things and wind up going their separate ways.As director, Scorcese brings his usual flair and visual inventiveness to the film, soaring highest - as is appropriate, perhaps - in the aviation sequences. The first hour, in particular, moves at a breathless clip, as he weaves the various strands of his epic - yet, at the same time, intimate - story into a cohesive whole. If the truth be told, at 170 minutes, the movies does run a little too long and it sags a bit in its middle section. However, as Hughes begins to unravel psychologically - at one point locking himself in a screening room barely clinging to what little remains of his sanity - the movie becomes a sad but fascinating study of a man in the throes of a nervous breakdown. The scene in which Hepburn converses with Hughes through a locked door, pleading with him to let her come in and help him, is heartbreaking in its poignancy.As Hughes, Leonardo Di Caprio carries the weight of the film on his frail shoulders, and he does a superb job, hitting new dramatic heights in the scenes in which he both falls to pieces psychologically and rises confidently to the challenge of clearing his good name in a senate hearing. Alan Alda is also terrific as the senator from Maine determined to get Hughes to sell TWA to Pan Am in order to achieve a monopoly on international flight carriers in the future.The first half of the 20th Century provided fertile soil for individuals like Hughes to grow and flourish, men with the brains to see what the future offered and the guts to reach out and go for it. The film captures the era beautifully through the art deco architecture, the dazzling sets and costumes, and a nostalgia-evoking soundtrack overflowing with familiar period standards.What Scorcese undoubtedly understands is that Hughes continues to cast a spell over the general public not because of what he accomplished as a moviemaker, an inventor, an entrepreneur, but because he did all those things battling demons that made him both inexplicably strange and, at the same time, more recognizable as a human being with weaknesses very much like ourselves.

By the number of nominations of \"The Aviator\", the minimum that I could expect would be to know a little about the biography of this American businessman. Unfortunately, the great director Martin Scorcese made a beautiful expensive movie, typically aiming to win the Oscar, but emotionally very shallow and with a very weak screenplay, with many parts very similar to a big soap-opera. After 170 minutes running time, I am not sure whether Howard Hughes was a genius, or a psychotic irresponsible prodigal millionaire born in silver spoon. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, was miscast with his baby-face in the role of Howard Hughes. The cast is excellent, and the production is outstanding, but in the end I was not fully satisfied with this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Aviador\" (\"The Aviator\")",

The cinematography itself is probably the biggest star of the movie, second place going to Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, and third to Leonardo DiCaprio for Hughes the Aviator himself. Touching, funny, and often spectacular. The film catches the 1930 is by pastiche as much as realism. Most memorable line for me is Hepburn's 'people like us are different' summing up the double-edged sword that is celebrity based on eccentric genius. Scorsese's description of Hughes' battle to save his reputation in the face of big business backed politicians makes him a sympathetic hero, and perhaps most wonderful of all is how the director would have us judge Howard Hughes by his great achievements, rather than his notorious image. He may not be a conventional hero in the Hollywood style, but this story of genius oppressed by disability and judged by a media more interested in a story than the facts can only do credit to the memory of the much maligned millionaire.",

I loved the movie, but I can totally relate, in one way or another, to a person that hated this movie.

The movie's best quality, in my opinion, is its originality. The airplane sequences, the lavish Hollywood parties and the way the movie was shot (not with a standard camera but with another type) definitely contributed to its originality. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was how \"heavy\" it really was at times.

The story of Howard Hughes is a fascinating one; on one hand, a forward-thinker and genius of aviation (among many, many other things) and on the other, a man crippled by obsessive-compulsive disorder. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as the lead and the movie (focusing more on Hughes' younger years) is an amazing, enjoyable watch from start to finish. Nice work with the CGI too.

                "comment": "The Aviator finds Scorsese back at close to top form after some of the disappointment that attended The Gangs Of New York (2002). This is partly because in Howard Hughes the director has once again found a driven, flawed character such has typically appeared in his most successful work. Like a Travis Bickle, Henry Hill, or Jake La Motta, Hughes is another self-tortured soul on the way to a dramatic end, a journey whose effects are orchestrated by a filmmaker currently at the height of his powers. And unlike the narrative weaknesses which informed his previous film, The Aviator has a strong story line with a coherent and compelling sweep, one which takes events down several decades with ease. The Academy obviously thought so, as the film won five out of its 11 Oscar nominations.At centre of Scorsese's biopic is reclusive flyer, aircraft designer, film producer, eccentric lover, and multi-millionaire obsessive-compulsive Hughes, whose colourful career surely provides enough material for a dozen films. He's been portrayed before of course: notably by Tommy Lee Jones (The Amazing Howard Hughes, 1977), and Jason Robards (Melvin And Howard, 1980), and others. But none of these previous incarnations had the benefits of Scorsese's budget or his undeniable cinematic flair. Combined, they make for compelling viewing as we see Hughes' private life and career rise and soar, before entering the turbulent years of rivalry with Pan-Am over the transatlantic aero market and the entrepreneur's increasing mental problems. Indeed, part of the fun of Scorsese's film lies in the symptom-watching, judging just when the hero famously tips over the edge, anticipating his future years hidden away in shrouded hotel rooms with long nails and matted hair. (This viewer has it when Hughes raises his hand into the air, as if suddenly noticing germs, during a late screening of Hell's Angels). Scriptwriter John Logan co-wrote Gladiator, and so he's well used to organising a larger-than-life central character, while his writing on RK280 (1999), an account of the genesis of Citizen Kane, showed an informed and affectionate interest in the legendary tales of Hollywood. Like Welles did with Kane, Logan places the origin of Hughes' personality quirks firmly in his childhood, and includes a suggestive opening scene neatly encapsulating obsession, cleanliness, and aberrant sexuality.Some critics have felt that the director could profitably spent more time on Hughes' years as a recluse, but this would have meant a different, longer, and perhaps less satisfying film. In fact Leonardo DiCaprio's performance remains strongest when relating to others. His moments alone in his room, while dramatically necessary, are arguably weaker than when the declining Hughes interacts with disturbed intimates, although even in this isolation Scorsese gives madness a fascination of its own.DiCaprio's acting is to be commended in a film covering such ambitious ground, and is generally successful. One is reminded of Giant (1956), a film in which another youthful actor, James Dean, is called to play a character ageing over a span of years. Like Dean, DiCaprio is perhaps still too fresh faced be entirely convincing as a mature man, but its only a minor distraction. In fact this is the best he's been for some time, proof further that under Scorsese's guidance the actor is doing his finest work. The director certainly has no reservations about DiCaprio having already announced his starring part in a new gangster project, 'The Departed'. A fine supporting cast, notably Cate Blanchett as Hughes' main infatuation Katherine Hepburn - the only woman who apparently gave him a run for his money - and a still sprightly Alan Alda, marvellous as scheming Senator Brewster, helps matters along considerably.Inevitably in a film titled The Aviator, there's a lot of flying and chat about planes. Fortunately, Hughes thought big, and his outlandish projects (including one seaplane the 'Spruce Goose' the biggest ever built and which hardly flew) are eye candy in themselves, while Scorsese revels in the enthusiasm and drive which Hughes brought to his projects. Indeed Hughes is seen taking almost sensual pleasure in the smooth fuselage of his prototype aircraft, his hands feeling for the flush rivets with the same suspenseful concentration as he had earlier seducing a waitress in a club. In fact one senses that Hughes 'flies' his sexual conquests with the same daredevil and rocky approach as that with which he conquers the skies, as his career runs a fine balance between business and obsessive pleasure, risk and enterprise. The inevitable smash-ups, personal or mechanical, when they occur are well done whilst the surrounding intrigues of Hughes' life, whether in the studio, bedroom or congressional committee provide more than adequate distractions from any mundane aspects of aircraft engineering. In Scorsese's hands ultimately the 'aviator' of the title becomes more than a flyer; it becomes the defining mark of a man who took risks, lived too fast, perhaps rose too high until, Icarus like, he was doomed to collapse back.If there's a criticism of Scorsese's film it is that a good deal of the real life Hughes' more unpalatable character has been suppressed. Like Ford's Young Mr Lincoln (a film which Scorsese admires), there is an occasional air of hagiography about the man in earliest days, a visionary blessed by his personal integrity. But history tells us that this was someone who was a serial seducer of starlets (a characteristic made more palatable here), was rabidly anti-communist, and hated blacks. Clearly a lot of the extreme Hughes was jettisoned to make him a more sympathetic character but, sometime, there is still yet room for a rabid anti-biography.",

Much of the criticism landed on The Aviator has come about because of the fact that it's not very deep and while this is a problem for the film, it didn't upset me too much because what we do have is a stylish and always interesting film, which evenly covers up it's shortfall in substance with it's positive aspects. The film follows the story of Howard Hughes; an aeroplane and filmmaker in Hollywood's golden era. The film starts during the troubled shoot of Hughes' debut film; Hell's Angels, and ends somewhat prematurely as Hughes is still a young man. We are never really allowed to get into the subject's head, but this doesn't seem to be an accident, as it was obvious to me that Scorsese was more interested in portraying the history behind the man than his psychological profile. Scorsese gives us enough of the man to keep us interested in him, but stays true to the facts of his life to an extent in which the film is always kept interesting.Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have replaced Robert DeNiro as Scorsese's muse, and despite a disappointing turn in the sub-standard 'Gangs of New York', DiCaprio shines here and really does well as the rich, yet troubled, Hollywood icon at the centre of this story. Scorsese seems to have a bit overboard with the cast, as several big names of the present appear as big names of the past. Cate Blanchett irritated me just as much as the real Katherine Hepburn did, which shows the greatness of her performance. Kate Beckinsale and, surprisingly, Gwen Stefani give life to two of Hollywood's golden girls; Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow as well, while smaller roles such as that of the charismatic Errol Flyn fall to the likes of Jude Law. This was the film's major selling point for me - there's something great about the big stars of today portraying the big stars of the golden age, and the way that Scorsese populates almost every scene with the big names of the time ensures that this is as much a film fan's movie as it is a multi-million dollar blockbuster. Critics can complain about a lack of substance as much as they like, but what I saw here was an excellently stylish take on one of Hollywood's most intriguing figures, and I don't hesitate to call this Scorsese's finest hour since Goodfellas back in 1990.",

THE AVIATOR is a spectacularly bad film with a mere handful of terrific moments.It has been many years since I have seen a major Hollywood A-picture so filled with grotesque continuity gaffs. I am still scratching my head over how the stellar duo of Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker (perhaps one of the greatest living film editors) could have allowed such a sloppy film to go out like it did. Was the bulk of it farmed out to a team of cutters working on PowerBooks with 12\" screens, so they couldn't really make out the detail in the Panavision frame? There are an astonishing number of severe goofs, from characters facing the wrong direction after cuts to hats on heads where they weren't worn in the previous cut to overlapping dialogue which starts on closed mouths, etc. Period detail ranges from very close to completely forgotten (costumes, hair and makeup are often strictly contemporary). Attempts to replicate the \"look\" of 2-strip, and then 3-strip Technicolor are cute but highly inaccurate, and in the case of the 3-strip sections, utterly distracting.But the problems aren't limited to technical errors. Everyone is miscast. DiCaprio couldn't be more inappropriate as the middle-aged Hughes. Cate Blanchett turns in a very moving performance, but barely echoes Katherine Hepburn. Alan Alda plays... well... Alan Alda competently enough, but is a total one-note. Only Alec Baldwin, as a restrained Pan Am executive, pulls it off. And I won't even mention Kate Beckinsale's non-take on Ava Gardner.Perhaps the most appalling aspect to the whole mess is the reliance on CGI digital effects for the bulk of the action sequences. What is the difference between THE AVIATOR and a video game? Answer: none. How could Scorsese \"honor\" the pioneering action direction of Hughes on HELL'S ANGELS by replacing it with completely soulless, one-dimensional computer-driven animation? The mind reels.This is a very, very bad film.",

There is a third segment of us, that while being die-hard fans of the first three movies still are willing to give the second trilogy a chance, but are critical of what we see as mediocre attempts to relive a great trilogy.I consider myself part of number 3, which you will see in my reviews of all the Star Wars movies. I have Sith 7 stars, this 1 and will give clones 4 when my reviews are finished on this trilogy. Phantom Menace is half C Span and half kiddy movie. I have found it unwatchable and can't get through it a second time. Jake Lloyd can't act and it would have added to the plot to make Anakin 5-10 years older. I do not wish to insult those who like the movies, however, i do not see how you can enjoy them unless you are under the age of 11.The movie's plot is difficult to figure out. It is over some sort of blockade by the trade federation over the planet Naboo. If they have a problem why don't they just slap some tariffs on Naboo and let it be. Anyhow, there are the usual chases and star wars effects, none of which seem to work. The underwater chase especially is very boring. The pod race is a little better.Jar Jar, is some kind of drunken retarded sports' mascot.

Even the Emperor's \"Wipe them all out\" line is laughable considering he is using a bunch of second rate droids to do so and doing it over a trade dispute.

So all we have here is basically an introduction to a 12-hour movie. And boy, do we feel it. The plot has something to do with heavy taxes being perpetrated by the nasty 'Trade Federation.' Two Jedi Knights are dispatched to negotiate. It doesn't go well. We are (re-) introduced to R2D2 & C3PO (who is being built by young Annakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader - Eegads!). In the end, we have a huge battle on 3 fronts, highlighted by the light-saber duel between the 2 Jedi knights and Darth Maul - a Sith Lord. Why are they all fighting? And why not send 4 Jedi knights or 6, to simplify matters a bit? All the escalating problems in the next two films could have been avoided if the so-called wise Jedi Council distributed their warriors a bit more efficiently, rather than being stuck in this '2' mode. To me, the most interesting aspects of this flic is making the various connections between this movie and the ones already made which take place in the near future. For example, there is the other Sith Lord (the master - they always come in twos ... say what? - if you know they come in twos, then send four..never mind), who is obviously the evil emperor from \"Return of the Jedi\"(83), and played by the same actor. Then there's the hint that Annakin did not have a father - what's all that about? And these microscopic beings that live in everyone's blood symbiotically? Hah? Like \"Star Trek the Motion Picture\"(79), this film is easier to watch a 2nd time around, when one can relax and not worry about missing a line of dialog which explains half the plot. The obvious weakness to the flic is that after writing it, George Lucas doesn't have much directing to do: what's left is for his FX technicians to plan the high-speed action races, create the many creatures, and visualize the city-scapes on several worlds.

His performance: 8.5/10 Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi -- Ewan dishes a performance of slightly above-average status as the soon-to-be mentor to the chosen one. His performance: 8/10Natalie Portman as Queen Padme Amidala -- The only thing I can say in her behalf is that she was miscast. To be honest, the performance she delivers to this film is among the worst of her career. Well below-average performance: 4.5/10 Jake Lloyd as young Anakin -- Not to dismiss his acting ability, his performance was awful. Unfortunately, the ability he shows in the movie IS the extent of his ability. The casting of Lloyd as Anakin was a major miss! The performance: 3/10Last, thought not least, Ray Park as the extremely dangerous Sith Lord, Darth Maul -- I LOVED Park as Darth Maul! However, I was extremely disappointed in the makers of the film for not using him more. Darth Maul is among the greatest villains in cinematic history, and with that, one of the most underused gems of the screen as well. Park's performance: 8/10 -- In his infrequent and brief screen time, he subconsciously persuaded the audience to side with him, for finally a villain presented his or herself to be truly evil; something Vader couldn't fully pull off.Ahmed Best's contribution as Jar-Jar was a waste. I'm not going to dog on him, for in the eyes of the filmmakers, he did his part. Though, I believe Jar-Jar to be the film's largest mistake. So much could have been without Binks, such as a more serious approach to a film that tried and tried to provide some humor -- at which the film's creators failed miserably. In addition, it could have clipped the film's 2 hr. and 13 min. running time -- one that is not unbearably long, but unbearable because of Jar-Jar. The only reason I can think of Jar-Jar's existence is that the Gungans (his alien race) are needed by the Queen to help resist an attack by the Federation's clone army.

The Phantom Menace, therefore, must now be looked at through the eyes of Revenge of the Sith. The Phantom Menace is much more powerful in the context of Episode 3.The characters, especially young Anakin and Qui-Gon Jinn, give the viewer a more whole sense of the Star Wars saga. One can't help feeling sadness and regret when they see an innocent 9-year old who gives freely to others, knowing the suffering that person will end up giving and receiving when he becomes and adult. Yet, there is a bit of hope as well because we know that eventually he will be redeemed. We can go back and realize the greatness in Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn, the man who discovers the Chosen One. This can only be observed after learning in Episode 3 that it is Qui-Gon who first learns the path to immortality. It is his teachings that usher in a New Jedi Order. One realizes that without these new perspectives learned by Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the training of a Luke Skywalker that is resistant to the dark side cannot be possible.So, the advice of this author is to watch The Phantom Menace again with Episodes II-VI in mind.

OK, its primarily directed at children but it still sets the board for the coming films and accomplishes the necessary in terms of story. It also brings some new characters to the universe some of which are more successful than others.The acting in all Star Wars films are marked by the fact that George Lucas cannot write convincing dialog. They had the problem in the original trilogy and they have it in the two following sequels but it isn't any worse in this film than it were in the old films and it is certainly better than the dialog in Attack of the Clones. Liam Neeson has the biggest role in this film as Obi Wan's Jedi tutor Qui Gon Jin. He deals pretty well with the woolly dialog and his overall presence is considerable as it is in all of his previous films. Ewan McGregor has the thankless task of portraying a young Obi Wan Kenobi a role which Sir Alec Guinness played so brilliantly and was even nominated for an Oscar for. Ewan McGregor, however, doesn't seem to let this affect him too much and provides the first step he will take towards becoming the perfect Obi Wan Kenobi. He doesn't have too many lines but he makes himself noticed and that is enough. His part will grow in the films to come. Natalie Portman is decent but seems to be more affected by the fact that the dialog is so bad because her performance is mediocre at best. Ian McDiarmid plays a timid yet subtly powerful Palpatine and he, like McGregor, is only building up to become a main player. Jake Lloyd plays a very young Anakin Skywalker and he has been treated very unfairly by critics and general audience because being a child actor with Lucas' horrendous dialog is an impossible task and I therefore do not think it is completely fair to criticize him. All in all I think the characters are pretty well if simplistically described. All except the infamous Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). Jake Lloyd was unfairly treated but not Jar Jar because he really is one of the most annoying characters in movie history. His pathetic attempts at comic relief left me baffled time after time. What was Lucas thinking?!The effects are good. They have a more cartoon-like feel to them than the effects in the original trilogy but I for one think that these effects suit the universe very well. The space battles have never been better in my opinion (even though the entire Anakin-in-a-space-fighter-sequence was a mistake). What the battles lack in terms of tension, I think, they make up in style. The light-sabers look very cool and I like the fact that they have amplified the sound of them ever so slightly from the original films. It makes the light-saber battles seem more menacing. Speaking of light-saber battles this film has the second best light-saber battle out of the entire series (second only to Obi Wan's and Anakin's showdown in Revenge of the Sith). The epic battle between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Darth Maul will, I think, go down in history as one of the best sword battles in history. Ray Park may not have the voice of the character but he certainly has the skill and the screen presence. In fact he is almost as menacing as Darth Vader and his double bladed light-saber is a very nice touch. Episode I was nominated for an Oscar in the effects department but lost out to The Matrix which I think was fair. The effects in Episode I were stellar but they weren't innovative in the same way the effects in The Matrix were.The story is fairly straight forward but an addition to the new series is the politics. The lines are more blurred. Darth Sidius hasn't shown his real face yet. The whole politics thing is a nice touch. While the old films were very good they had a tendency towards being a little too simplistic for my taste. With that I'm not saying that they are bad because of their simplicity but I would have preferred a little more substance which I think The Phantom Menace adds to the universe.All in all I believe that Episode I is a pretty good film. It is not as good as the original films but it is certainly a worthy addition to the franchise. I do hope that people will come around and start liking the film for what it is: A piece of entertainment. I also believe that the Episode I was hurt by the fact that people had their hopes for the film in the sky and pretty much no film can live up to those kinds of expectations. 7/10",

However I do not believe that it is worthy of all the badmouthing it has received over these last lot of years by many critics. As regardless of some of the stuff it lacked in certain places I felt it made up for in other areas in the plot, acting and effects etc. Star Wars episode I The Phantom Menace told us the start of the saga involving two Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Nesson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor) who while on a mission to end the greedy trade federations blockade of the planet Naboo and restore peace to the Galatic Republic have to stop and have there starship repaired on the Hutt dictatorship planet of Tattoine, where they discover the young slave boy Anakin Shywalker who's dream is to one day fly away in a spaceship and train to become a great Jedi knight. Gui-Gon who believes strongly in young Skywalker chooses to take him with them back to the Jedi council to have him trained in the ways of the force, unaware that the path way he is taking will change him into the evil Sith lord we all now from the originals as Darth Vader. Another character that deserves a mention is Padme who was played perfectly by Nataile Portman. She is such a cute actress IMO.When I ask some of my friends why they disliked this film they usually blame it on the one same thing Jar Jar Binks, who I must say yes can be a bit annoying a lot of the time, although I must confess that I did find him rather hilarious in the battle between the Gungans and the federations droid armies. What I would say to people who hated The Phantom Menace due to Jar Jar is to just ignore him and not let him spoil the whole episode for you and concentrate on the rest of the story. The character who impressed me the most I would have to say is Qui-Gon Jinn due to the great acting from Liam Nesson who give yet another wonderful performance. Darth Maul was an excellent new villain and he, Gui-Gon and Obi-Wan have a great fight towards the end of the film, which has very good light sabre effects and is set in a rather interesting location. To be honest the only problems that I have with this movie are the pod race on Tattoine carrying on for a bit to long, the way it sometimes doesn't connect to the original trilogy very well in parts and there not being enough scenes with Darth Maul featured in them. Overall this movie is not perfect and by no means flawless. However I think it has been trolled enough over the years and its time to look for the more positive parts in the film which believe me do be come visible to your eyes once you watch it a certain number of times. Overall a Star Wars episode that is more good than it is bad ( Despite what others would tell you IMO ) I give episode one the Phantom Menace a well deserved 7/10 stars. Nothing beats \" The Empire Strikes Back \" though!",

This wasn't the Star Wars I fell in love with. In fact there's not much to love about this film. The \"story line\" is so convoluted and confusing, and the characters come and go so fast you can't figure out who they are. Lucas should have spent more time on creating an interesting story line worthy of Star Wars instead of relying on so many special effects (I felt like I was in a pinball machine with all the bright colors and glaring sounds) and bizarre costumes to distract us from the threadbare script. I started to watch this installment in hopes of watching \"Revenge of the Sith\" but now I have no intentions of seeing it.",

The first thought that comes to mind when I think of TPM is 'now, what was that one about?' This is one of the most 'substance-free' films I have ever had the misfortune of seeing; it just sort of starts with a bunch of fighting, then they talk awhile, then it ends with some shooting or fighting or something. One of the most engaging aspects of the Star Wars saga is its colorful and varied characters, the renegade Han, the idealistic but naive Luke, and so forth. This alone made up for the sometimes erratic performances in the 'old' installments. Unfortunately, Phantom's plot is non-existent (if you find it, please get back to me), and its characters are generally miserable, unlikeable little chunks of cardboard propped up with sticks. I finished viewing 'Phantom' with a feeling that most everyone on-screen could just have been killed off and it'd all be the same. Sadly, the only victims are dull Jedi Qui-Gon and poor Maul, who was the only one worth saving...The action and SFX are hollow and lifeless, seemingly slopped on there to cover up for the lack of any other good qualities. Lucas and his bunch are going just through the motions in this lackluster entry.All in all, a drab, boring film and a weak effort on Lucas' part.",

Usual explanation is that the storyline and characters were by far more interesting. Well, I don't agree. Although I also have very fond memories of the original Star Wars-movie (and it's sequels) since it was my very first non-cartoonish feature I saw in theater (twice) at age 10, I already back then realized that these movies aren't by any significant margin above cartoon-level anyhow. Awesome, epoch making, brilliantly entertaining scifi with great special effects surely. So throughout the 1990's after I first heard that George Lucas was planning those brand new episodes, becoming possible by revolutionary CGI-technology, I knew there was something spectacular on its way. And I wasn't disappointed. To my money, now having seen them all, Episode I - The Phantom Menace is The Best of the whole series: Special FX leave nothing to desire, just as one assumed; action-scenes and overall pace are beautifully orchestrated; Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are among my very favorite actors and their line delivery is always ear-pleasing, no matter what they say; and it all climaxes in the greatest sword-fight ever, laser or not, in movie history. Granted, there are long speeches and meetings couple too many, the podrace-scene is a tad too long also, and obligatory funny \"black\" character Jar Jar Binks is VERY unfunny, but those are minor flaws. Especially compared to myriad of shortcomings found in former episodes, particularly in Return Of The Jedi, the only actual black sheep of the whole saga. Once and for all, it's mind blowing effects that have always defined these movies for me, other aspects come distant second.",

He's right.Star Wars Episode I is enjoyable, but its main strength lies in the CG sequences, which are impressive, though some of them seem to be screaming:\"Look at what you can do with modern technology!\".The story, about how Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi met Anakin Skywalker, isn't bad, but there are a few elements that make it a bit, uh, ridiculous: 1.The midi-chlorians: was it necessary to add information about the Force's origin when no one asked for it? 2.Darth Maul:He's only a puppet in the Sith lord's hands, and the only line he says in the entire film is pretty forgettable; 3.Jar Jar Binks: He was supposed to add humor to the movie? We already had C-3PO doing that! Even the Ewoks are better than Jar Jar.Lucas tries to compensate these flaws with the previously mentioned CG and some good acting (particularly Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman), but in the end this is the one Star Wars episode that doesn't justify repeated viewings.6,5/10",

                "comment": "Frankly, when I walked out of this movie, I was positive that everyone around me, and not around me, were pretty much crazy. It was the first movie since Jurassic Park to totally take me out of my stiff theater seat and transport me into a place of pure magic. Right from the opening scene with the Jedi taking control of the situation and putting their lightsabers to good use, I knew I was in for it. I think this episode is a constant joy, constant magic and excitement, and it has it's fair share of mystery and emotion too. It's an all around great film, and a great Star Wars film - and I honestly - ESPECIALLY now, don't think Lucas could of started the story off any better. People complain about it being kid friendly and overly happy and all that, but it's mainly for contrast reasons - it's the whole point. I expected the galaxy to be a more happier and lush place, I expected a more lighthearted atmosphere, ...and that's what it gave. It's the Pride Lands before Scar (the Empire) takes over. You can't introduce a world that's going to fall apart and be shrouded in darkness, in a six part saga no less, all dark and creepy right off the bat; where would the emotion come from when everything actually does go to hell? Exactly, It'd be nonexistent.That subject aside, I have to go against the \"majority\" when it comes to this movie. I'm as dazzled, amazed, moved, and awed by the atmosphere as I watch this movie as I am with the others. In some cases, more so. Ridiculous? If you call me that, I can't stop you. I'm just enhancing the idea of how much I in fact like Menace as the start of this treasure of a saga.One of the main reasons why I wasn't disappointed came from plain logic: I knew before Episode I came out that we'd get a lighter film, with a lot of exposition and slow pace setting up the saga. It was pretty obvious to me that that's what we'd get in Episode I. We wouldn't get another Empire Strikes Back or a Jedi - we'd get a starting point of a six part story that acts as a set up. I walked out of Menace thoroughly satisfied while people next to me asked \"From Empire to this ? That's just missing the point. I'll say it bluntly: A majority of people totally, and still are, missing the point. That's why Menace is so blasted. No kidding it's not like Empire, no kidding it's not like the \"originals\". I mean it is, where it counts - humor, action, and style and everything that makes Star Wars so fun - but again Menace isn't a hardcore dive into the fast moving meat of the story like Empire and Jedi are, along with Revenge of the Sith. This is why Sith so favored. People are like \"ohhh this is what should of been the first time!\". Sorry, but no. You don't start a six part story off like a bat out of hell immediately getting to the things that people really want to see. Everything Menace offered, while bashed, were extremely necessary and Sith wouldn't of been half the \"finally, Star Wars is back in full swing\" movie if it wasn't for this so called \"inferior\" and \"lame\" film. I just don't think people understand how it is you should start an epic story properly. This is why I put Menace proudly next to the latter films and call it a perfectly told saga.On the subject of the often bashed Jake Lloyd, you know, it may come as no surprise but I thought he did great. Again, it's all about contrast. This movie needed to establish that Vader was once just... a pure innocent child like anyone else. That alone is very emotional to me. He was a complete 180. It much relates to serial killers. They didn't start off as evil monsters, but were more so made that way, and also made some very bad decisions. I thought Jake nailed Anakin as Lucas intended the character to be at this stage. Sure, things like \"Now this is podracing!\" cannot be done well ...by anyone; however I know where Lucas was going with this kind of thing. Even so, you won't hear me say everything Lucas writes is perfect. However, when we're treated to each and every conversation between Qui Gon Jinn and Shmi or and Anakin and Shmi ...\"perfect\" is a word you'll hear me utter tons. The conversations in this movie are fantastic. Much like Prisoner of Azkaban, some of this episode's strongest moments come out of simple conversation, and of course both films scenes are both aided by the masterful John Williams. The scene where Anakin runs back to his mother as he's about to leave to become a Jedi is one of the most powerful and heart wrenching moments in the entire saga, not to mention the utter brutality of emotion to follow just seconds later. After seeing Episode II, and soon Revenge of the Sith, this scene will be unbearable. Phantom Menace lacks emotion? What a gravely mistaken statement.To conclude my newest review, I think it's a complete triumph of imagination and superior storytelling. It's treated so unfairly that it's just amusing to me more than anything else.5/5 out of a solid 5/5 saga.",

When it was finally there, there was a very mixed feeling among the die - hard fans. Some fans found the movie quite annoying, and didn't even considered it as a Fake - Star Wars movie. There was a lot of criticism about the character called Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar was a Gungan, saved by Jedi Master Qui - Gon Jinn. I've seen the movie so many times since 1999, and I can finally conclude that it is true that Jar Jar is irritating in a way. But according to me he isn't the most irritating character in the movie. Take a look at the little Jake Lloyd. Real Star Wars fans should be ashamed of this little boy, who just can't act, and is portraying one of the most disturbing characters in the entire saga: the (fallen) Jedi Anakin Skywalker, who turns into the dark lord of the sith Darth Vader. I just can't understand why Lucas cast Lloyd and not a true child star like Harvey Joel Osmont. The second most irritating character is the utterly useless Gungan-boss called Boss Nass. He is just so annoying, and poorly animated. So if you did not watch this movie yet, you must be living on mars, keep your eyes shut when Lloyd and Boss Noss make the appearance.",

In fact Lucas had the opportunity to outstrip the originals had he so wished. I believe that Lucas had no intention of making a good film; his mind was on two things: MONEY and EGO. He wanted to make a series in the style of \"Titanic\", which many would love, and the rest would grudgingly admit to having found entertaining. But he made a crucial mistake. He underestimated the intelligence of even your average American moron. He attempted the biggest con in cinema history, and failed. Even the American public was not going to let him take the p*ss out of them so blatantly.>Star Wars was essentially a war film in space. Simple idea. Just chuck in some authentic characters, amazing sets and a brilliant score and you're away. The master stroke was the addition of the mystical \"force\".But what made the original films - and any self respecting fan will acknowledge this - was its humanity. The only way the whole thing could be kept from being laughably absurd was the injection of a healthy dose of believable people to set against the unfamiliar background. That way the story had some emotion.Tatooine, in ANH really does look like the arse end of the galaxy, unlike the well developed shiny planet of TPM. We understand why Luke wants to get away. Even the narrow mindedness of uncle Owen is convincing. The film actually builds up tension as the stormtroopers search for the heroes in Mos Eisley, while TPM is completely lacking in this attribute. Notice how Lucas cleverly replaces stormtroopers with droids so that the Jedi's can spend the whole film hacking them to pieces - which would be far too gory in the case of actual soldiers.Then there's the main aspect that adds that little bit extra to ANH: the enigmatic back story of Obi-Wan, Darth Vader and Luke. In contrast in TPM we have the unspeaking, storyless \"Darth Maul\" and no explanation of the opposition of the Sith and the Jedi. And anyone who found \"Darth Sidious\" exciting has to be pretty stupid. That side of things gets minimal time in the film, and it's just a case of \"Oh right so that's the Emperor then\". It's like Lucas made all three prequels without managing to really cover any of the interesting stuff.Lucas destroys the mysticism of the Force with some pointless \"midiclorian\" idea, and then conversely can't be satisfied with Vader being a human who turned bad and makes him in to some kind of counter-Christ virgin birth figure. I have no problem with Anakin being a child, and the podrace thing has a certain logic to it, as well as the scene of him leaving his mother, but from there on it's impossible for the central character to exhibit any character or realistically participate in any action. It would have been far more sensible if there were at least some negative aspects of the future Vader's childhood life, or if he had some residual Jedi abilities (or if he was a bit older).An earlier reviewer suggested that Lucas is being castigated for trying new ideas instead of remaking the originals. On the contrary. He chose to use old elements, such as CP30 and R2D2 and the planet tatooine, when this would only give the films a feeling of gimmicky fakeness. Anyone with a brain would find it odd that 3PO forgot that he had been made on Tatooine or met Obi Wan, or that Obi Wan would completely forget the droids: \"I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid\". Then Lucas creates new elements such as Amidala and Jar Jar, who are just poor analogues of characters from the originals. The gunguns were basically the ewoks (natives!) in even more annoying form, and Amidala just an insipid and wooden version of Leia! (Jar Jar = Chewbacca).The most amazing thing of all was that Lucas actually denied us what we came to see: amazing battle scenes. The final space battle scene was rushed and undramatic. The one on Naboo was choreographed, cartoony and unrealistic. The blaster shoot out in the palace was perfunctory and pedestrian. At no point was there EVER a sense that the good guys might not win. And to cap it all, Lucas goes against the entire spirit of the originals by making the good guys win by pure chance, not through any striving or ability! ANH thrived on the fact that the audience was rooting for the underdog against all odds. TPM was basically the opposite of everything a straight forward blockbuster should be, whilst completely lacking the depth of character, acting, plot or action sequences that it would need to be anything more.Lucas focused on the Darth Vader story, which we all wanted to see, but did not develop it at all, so that we were left totally unsatisfied at the end. As a result the rest of the film was just a pointless, meaningless background with no adversity at all.This is probably the worst film ever made.",

It lacked the plot, fast pace and likable characters of the trilogy, but most of all it lacked real purpose (other than making money) - it seemed to me that Lucas really had nothing to say.Sure, he is unrivaled in his ability to create visually stunning images and visually interesting action sequences, but these need to be a backdrop to a good story - not a substitute for one.It was also difficult to tell who the intended audience was. Children would find much of the political machinations to be dull or incomprehensible, while adults are left shaking their heads at the child-like simplicity in which adult relationships are depicted. And then there is the painfully awkward dialog - one that made the gifted cast seem as wooden as amateur players.In summary, this film should be avoided by anyone who is seeking entertainment value.",

Star Wars is one, possibly the, most famous trilogy of all time.... so why did this movie suck so much?!One: The acting was bad, especially little Anikin. When Anikin is flying that ship at the end and spewing those cheesy one-liners I felt like killing myself.Two: The pod racer scene was obviously put in there to take up time and advertise the Pod-Racer video game for the N64. Three: Jar-Jar Binks.Four: There was no big fight scene except the droids vs those f*****g Jar-Jars. Which basically ruined the scene. And then that silly little par between the weird guy and the other two guys. That fight sucked too.Five: Too many side plots.Six:...................do I really have to go on?

I have a little 9-year-old brother and it delights me to think that at least one little boy his age-in another galaxy or not-is not that horrible. Poor little Jake has suffered much criticism, i think he did a good job. After all, he was following a script and a young boy of nine can't be expected to be the best actor ever. Then there is Jar-Jar. i don't see why people don't like him so much. i think he is a fantastic character, though granted he is not my favourite. Yes, he is a little annoying at times, but some people seem to be incapable of using their imaginations! All the aliens in the star wars galaxy are different, unique. if they weren't it would be just plain boring. Star wars episode one was designed to introduce the characters of star wars... the famous Anakin and where he came from, the as yet unknown mother of Luke and Leia, Yoda, Obi-Wan and what the Jedi were before things changed drastically. It also introduces the idea of the Sith. Darth Maul wasn't such a bad character... Can anyone imagine him talking more then he does? It wouldn't be right. Yes, it is sad how the tradition of Talking through crossed lightsabers is broken, but whats to be said? \"You are weak!\" \"So... are you the master, or the apprentice. The Jedi council will be really interested to know.\" \"You will never defeat the Sith!\" No.... it wouldn't work, at least not for me. I loved the pod-racing. The sound they make as they round the bends, the aspect of danger that is portrayed, a little boy facing the odds with only the Force he doesn't even know. I was so excited when he won and Selbulba was defeated! Ahhhh... Padme. In the first prequel movie i think that she has got to be my favourite character, followed closely by Anakin. a fourteen year old queen, saving her world. i love that prospect. Brilliant. i am only 12, and i saw the original trilogy when i was little, it had been out for many, many years already. I also watched at that time episode one and two, but the years went by and i forgot it all. Then at a friends house last year i watched episode one... and was hooked. i have been an obsessed star wars freak since then. it is not my favourite star wars movie, but it was enough to convert me. It can't be that bad, so give Lucas a break.",

                "comment": "Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I've always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with \"The Phantom Menace\" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he's just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story's outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn't portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren't explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can't help being conscious of how he's manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin's portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn't appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he's special is that the plot requires it.If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what's happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet's inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.It's true that \"A New Hope\" never showed Alderaan's inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet's destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke's foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren't there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was \"Return of the Jedi,\" which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In \"The Phantom Menace,\" he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren't given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon's word for it when he describes Obi Wan as \"headstrong.\" What's most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie's best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can't hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children's book that isn't very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a \"wow\" factor in the movie's visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the \"Star Wars\" movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they're not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy's continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today's standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they're almost universally acknowledged to be.",

And only because it was the first Star Wars movie in 16 years is what allowed it to be the top movie in 1999.The story involves the peaceful world of Naboo being invaded by the greedy Trade Federation, and the first meeting of a 9 year old Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, when he was only a Jedi trainee, or what they call a padawan. This movie is suppose to have started the whole Star Wars saga. But unfortunately the prequel is too heavily reliant on the original trilogy and probably the most forgettable Star Wars installment.As with all Star Wars films, the visual effects are incredible. And special commendations for the incredible alien species shown, excluding Jar Jar Binks of course. The pod racing scene not only meets, but exceeds expectations. But outside of the visual effects, the pod racing scene, the costumes, and the sets, this movie has very little to offer.Even with a battle sequence near the beginning, the movie is pretty slow and lame. Its level of interest however rockets at the pod race scene, but then it drops after that. And it only inches its way back up at the climax.The climax of the movie has 3 battle scenes. On the planet of Naboo, the star-fighter sequence in orbit, and the Jedi lightsabre sequence. Out of all those 3, the Jedi scene barely meets expectation. The other 2 are disappointing, despite the special effects.If the Phantom Menace were to have been released before the original Star Wars, the Star Wars saga would never have taken off. Never have even reached episode 2. If they learned anything from Star Trek, pretty soon, not even the name Star Wars will save the next film, if there were a 7th. And Star Wars will crash a lot sooner than Star Trek.",

Control and self reflection is what brings this duality of man to life within the giant capacitor scene of Star Wars the Phantom Menance. The unknown or fear verse knowledge and the insight to use that knowledge correctly.In Pennsylvania Westinghouse electric was fortunate to use a giant Van De Graff generator for \"atom smashing\" studies in particle physics. If not for the lumber industry and train disasters George Westinghouse and Nicola Tesla may have never met. But the air brake changed history in the lumber industry of the West. Tesla changed AC voltage production with Westinghouse at Niagra Falls. Thus history was altered by economic pressure.Orthodox values in change with conditions is a vital thought process. For example 200 years ago a British General by the name of St. Clair was defeated in Western Pennsylvania by the six nations of native North Americans because of his orthodox military values against gorilla warfare.Today, in modern cinema, what does the Phatom Menace really offer in terms of entertainment. High quality color & sound. Does this plot really reflect the major theme of the Star Wars trilogy? Or, is entertainment being driven like technology by economic pressure? When a pilot is asked to do a duty in combat do they need to ask why? Who is the combat pilot? The stress of advancing technology pushing the human physiology to its limits of failure? Why must the combat pilot do their duty? Is it a job or a duty? I guess it depends on the person and the given the person they decide the duty to match skill and desire to meet the objective.Take the movie for what its worth in terms of entertainment, I liked it.

                "comment": "Let me start off by saying that this movie was R-O-B-B-E-D at the Academy Awards. No nominations for Best Costumes, Best Makeup, or Best Art Direction is downright stupid. Aesthetically, this film was downright beautiful. I really honor George Lucas for realizing a time when The Republic was at its prime, and it was basically a golden age for the galaxy. The special effects are also fantastic and, in my opinion, was the first really big visual effects film that broke down the door for other FX films like LOTR. Truly brilliant.Writing wise, I felt the film was kind of flat and uninspired, if you will. The plot was almost incoherent (even now I don't know what the film is exactly about) and the story with the Trade Federation is unnecessarily complicated. The dialog is probably the worst of the six (but AOTC had some bad lines). \"Are you an angel?\" If you compare it to the original trilogy, dialog like that doesn't seem right and comes off sort of awkward. However, I will give George Lucas credit for bringing attention in very subtle ways to Palpatine and his intentions. Seeing him rise to power is a really neat tie-in to the original trilogy.Acting wise, the movie isn't all too spectacular either. Liam Neesan does his best to keep the movie flowing, and for the most part, he does pretty well. He didn't really have that great of a script to work with. Ewan McGregor wasn't given that great of a part, but it's obvious that his time to shine came in the next two episodes. Pernilla August does a wonderful job of playing the mother part, and it's a shame that they gave her such a small role. Jake Lloyd, to put it very very kindly, was stilted. He tried, I know, but I can't help but roll my eyes when ever I hear \"Yipee!\". On the other hand, it's hard to hold your own when you have a bad script to work with. Ray Park is the best performance of the film, even though he delivers the fewest lines. His intensity and the way he digs in to the role makes you unable to take your eyes off of him whenever he's on screen. They couldn't have made a better cast choice.I haven't said much positive about the movie, but I will say now that the action in this film is unparalleled. Almost instantly the excitement grabs a hold of you and keeps you wanting more. Some of the best sequences, such as the stunning three-person lightsaber duel and the masterfully executed podrace scene, hold their own against the best action of the saga, and even manage to surpass some. George Lucas did a marvelous job of planning these scenes, and even though the film may have been panned, it is undeniable that these sequences influenced action films of the coming years. Action in one word: breathtaking.If there was another nit-pick I could make, it would be how this film really looks nothing like the original films. It's a beautifully shot and decorated movie, I know, but I can't help but think \"How did it change so fast in 30 years? Why has everything gone to crap?\" Oh, and don't even get me started on that Yoda! It's not that he's a puppet, but that he looks NOTHING like he did in the other films! I really hope George fixes this in the future. And I don't think I need to talk about the Gungans. It's been beaten to death and I personally didn't mind Jar Jar as much as everyone else did.That being said, this movie was by no means the piece of crap mess that people originally said. I thought it was a fun, epic, visually amazing, yet emotionally flat addition to the Star Wars saga. Yes, it was a bit disappointing and yes, it is the worst of the Star Wars films, but it's still a non-stop thrill ride that is well worth watching and is actually better once you've seen the other five films.",

Some people compare it to The Shining. There is even the obligatory overhead shot referring to this movie. But they are worlds apart. This is so lazy and unimaginative in its execution that it is hardly lifted above the average. The house offered many possibilities to explore as a character (with its ghosts) but all the shots in and around the house are without any imagination. As Chelsea enters the roof there are few shots suggesting depth. As the ghosts are shown, they have almost no dramatic impact on the viewer. The transformation of George the father is not very insightful portrayed for the viewer: He turns from father to maniac in an instant and that's not very plausible. A plot twist could have helped the movie regain some interest half-way (e.g. George non-existent but only imagined, George a reincarnation of the original killer). But we are served a simple explanation (why has there to be one at all and why that simple?).Horror movies go through a difficult period. There is an audience out there, but we need more creativity from the people who make them. The true horror here lies in the making of another dismal product supported by Michael Bay and friends.",

Most of the scary scenes were predictable and played very little with my fear. The actors were good especially Mellisa George who was able to carry the film forward and interesting. What I would really like to know is if this home still exists!

I try to judge movies on their own merits rather than comparing to them to their originals. If you remember my review of Seed of Chucky, I quoted Pauline Kael as saying \"Movies are so rarely great art that if we cannot appreciate great trash we have very little reason to be interested in them.\" Unfortunately there is always times where the trash really stinks and you just want to get rid of it anyway you can. Enter the film, The Amityville Horror.George (Ryan Reynolds) & Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) and Kathy's 3 children are moving into an elegant Long Island home for a reasonable price. The reason why is that 5 savage murders were committed there the year before by Ronald DeFeo Jr., son of a wealthy car dealer who murdered his parents, brothers & sister by shooting them in November 1974. No sooner when the Lutz's move into the house, they begin seeing horrible things - the ghost of Jody DeFeo, horribly disfigured bodies, and hearing ghostly voices throughout the house. George seems to notice it the most, and it isn't long before he becomes a danger to those around him.First I want to get this out of the way: This is NOT based on a true story. Both Ronald DeFeo and George and Kathy Lutz concocted this story for their own personal reasons. However, it is true that I wish I hadn't seen this movie. This is such a flawed movie, that not even a blessing from the Pope could save it. Since Michael Bay is attached as producer, you know there will be such wonderful bits of dialogue like \"There is no bad houses. Just bad people.\" Go figure. I was also appalled and insulted by this movie's exploitive nature. There were at least 4 to 5 separate scenes with actor Ryan Reynolds without a shirt, yet the camera makes sure to film him from the top of his head to right below his abdomen to show off his manly and muscled physique. What was the purpose of this? That's right: it had no purpose except to appeal to the brain-dead audience members in the hopes of distracting them from this god awful \"script.\" Let's go right into the reason we see horror movies: to be scared. This movie does not even come close in trying to be scary. It wants to be a cross between The Shining and The Haunting, and expectedly, miserably fails at both. Alfred Hitchcock once said \"There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.\" This movie bangs in your face so loudly that you wonder \"What the heck was that?\" That's what made The Shining and The Haunting so frightening, while you knew something was going to happen, you didn't know how or when. Even Helen Keller could've predicted this movie's \"scares\" from a mile away. Those silly, fast jump cuts and \"scary ghost is behind the character\" really didn't help that much either.As for the actors, they try their best with what they are given in the script and by the director. Ryan Reynolds is tolerable and does his split-personality scenes very well. Melissa George is just there honestly for eye candy. The kids are barely interesting as characters. The only person who seemed interesting at all was the babysitter played by Rachel Nichols who seems to be genuinely having fun with her role. The makeup by KNB Efx. is up to their usual great standard with their penchant for over-the-top blood and gore.I am not happy writing this review. Unlike with The Aviator, which I felt motivated to make sure people didn't see, I feel sick writing a review for a movie that I absolutely did not like. While there needs to be a great balance between seeing art and trash, no one should find time to see garbage such as The Amityville Horror.",

The scares were Far more original than any movie in recent years, and yes, it did start to lose me a little in the last 30 minutes. But it was one one hell of a ride up to that point. I have been a horror fanatic since I was 6, I love being scared. And this is the first movie in a long time that actually had me amped up as I left the theater. I say kudos and thumbs up to the makers of this film. And everyone else out there that disagrees can just Suck It!",

I recommend this movie to all horror-movie fans 'cause it will kept you on your site. Simply a masterpiece in which Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George do a credible role. Good special effects, excellent story, great shots with good perspectives and the special touch that this kind of movie need to be watched.

If you're in for some good special effects and screams from teenagers in the seat behind, well then maybe this is your film. I was in for a good horror movie, which knowing from the hype it would be not, but nonetheless \"watchable\" in terms of plot and acting. For the most part the movie focused on the 'husband' which is in fact a comedy actor that really doesn't fit the part, and as expected the wife is indeed hot as we are used to nowadays. You would wish the clich\u00e9s had stopped there, but no, they keep on coming for the rest of film up to the end of it which in my opinion was dumb and very very weak.I should mention that in this movie there are things like a dead little girl, dead people in the basement, ghosts appearing in the mirror, and the list goes on... In a nutshell this movie was kind of entertaining in a manner that it is actually well made in terms of special effects and is fast-paced, but the story is totally irrelevant and the acting is very very poor. I would recommend you skip this one and go watch something different for a change.",

This is really scary though, not like the 1979 version where you get no chills. Ryan Reynolds was terrific, Melissa George was also. All the actors did an excellent job. This has to be one of the scariest movies of 2005, and its based on a true story which is even better. Everyone should check out Amityville 2: The Possession which came out in 1982. This took place before Amityville Horror (1979) when the killings took place. Also check out Amityville 3-D. A reporter for a magazines, catch the people living there at the present time playing a hoax, and making it look like the house is haunted, and later moves in. Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes takes place when no one currently lives in the Amityville house, and the evil is transported through a huge, ugly lamp to a home in California. There are 4 more i have yet to watch. Please enjoy the Amityville series.",

After all that movie is considered a classic, and this remake is about as far away from a classic as it's possible to get.I don't know what it is with Hollywood and horror movies. I have thought about it for quite some time now. I have seen a lot of horror movies lately and almost all of them have been awful. I had hardly had time to recover from the awful \"Skeleton Key\" before this heap of dung fell into my lap. Not only is this movie completely lacking when it comes to originality, it's also a horror movie like it would be if it was made by a child with ADD.The story about the house that is evil and compels people to murder when they move in could have worked in my opinion. Of course we have seen it before since it's a remake, but it's a solid concept. The problem here is that director Andrew Douglas has absolutely no idea how to make a horror movie. The movie actually begins quite tolerably, but it doesn't stay that way for long. As soon as the creepy stuff begins it's 100% full speed ahead from there. Ghosts sit in every corner, the house constantly whispers about murder and strange shapes and shadows lurk everywhere. Douglas should do himself a favor and look up the word \"subtlety\" in a dictionary.The thing is though that even if he would have relaxed a bit with the effects this would still have been crap. What Hollywood doesn't understand is what made the originals of movies like this one and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" popular. Was it the effects (NO!), the plot (NO!) or the acting (GOD NO!)? No, it was the fact that people were actually watching something they had never seen before! A movie where they couldn't predict the next scene every time! And that's what i want to see, that's what's scary! Not this formulaic \"Horror Movie 1A\" crap on speed. This is not scary, just annoying. And i rate it 2/10, still considering myself to be generous.",

But it was supposed to be based on the acclaimed Jay Anson's book... seriously, it looks like nobody involved in the film making read it!!! It has almost none of the elements that made the book so fantastic. I was disappointed.1) Jodie, a girl? C'mon! So she's supposed to be more frightening than a huge ghost PIG??? Read the book and you will fear Jodie, the pig.2) They hardly saw spirits and these kind of stuff in the house. It's much more psychological horror, things moving, pigs (Jodie) stepping over you, pig \"footprints\" on snow, lion statues moving, than gore ghosts. Read the book!!! 3) Why does he wake up at 3:15 in the movie? Nothing is explained... I know, it's the time when Ronald got all possessed and killed his family. But the book version is far more disturbing... is the time of their necropsy!4) There never was a possession, and I thought that was completely pointless. (By the way, it was stupid to make George a stepfather instead of being the real father... pointless!)Finally, is a good horror movie, but a terrible, terrible book adaptation, but that's just my opinion.",

I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say even the ending was not only anti-climatic but also didn't resolve everything. The father in this film was not nearly as convincing as the actor in the original, same for the mother. Neither is a cinematic masterpiece, however this remake has such a lack of depth and development that at least the original had to at least keep your interest all the way through.

Horror needs new ideas, and if someone dares remaking a classic they'd better do it by innovating not plainly re-filming the original.

NO. it was a friend. i owe him a return favour now so i'm going to take him the director's cut of Alexander. then we'll be even. the only character i felt badly for was the dog. he was forced to be in this film and probably didn't get any money for it either. a side of beef wouldn't have been enough compensation. there wasn't a single scene in this film that i found convincing. it borrowed clich\u00e9s from at least a million movies, even with an original and a book to model it on. this film makes the original movie look like a masterpiece. and Michael Bay can add this remake to his accelerating list of bad bad movies that he's directly or indirectly involved with. and a true story? this is a case where truth is better than fiction. to be fair, i don't believe anyone felt this was going to be an award-winning A-grade film competing for Oscars. but movies should at the very least, entertain. i found watching this a painful experience because i hate wasting my time.",

Granted some of the things that happen are a total rip off of such recent films like \"The Grudge\" and \"The Ring\", but it still makes for an entertaining horror film. Unlike those two mentioned above, however, this film is a bit more graphic and is actually rated R which at least steers away from the trend of making the pg-13 horror film for the entire family. The film has a lot of the same elements as the first one, it keeps the same date and setting...a family where the father is a step moves into a house that should be out of their price range, but isn't. Why? Well there were murders there of course, another family was killed there and it kind of brings down the price considerably. Why are all real estate agents so darn gung ho about selling a house that they never tell the new owners about the odd stuff they see in just the few minutes they are there. Well everything goes great, that first afternoon while moving in, after that visions of those slain appear at the most inappropriate times and blood drips freely from various objects. Throw in a really annoying babysitter that gets a bit more than she deserves (being fired would be more appropriate) and you got yourself a very nice and a bit bloody haunted house movie. The only weak spot I thought there would be is Ryan Reynolds in the lead role, but he did rather good, but I still think Brolin was better as George Lutz, but they seemed to be going for a more of a Shining type possession rather than the more subtle one of the earlier movie.

As to the non-CGI aspects of the film, it's a rather tedious affair with predictable humour and uninspired dialogue. Not even close to the wit and originality of your average Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon (of course, those were brilliant so I suppose that's an unfair comparison, since no one these days seems able to write with that level of flair or originality). I find when viewing these sorts of films that it helps to imagine what they would be like if the images were all hand-drawn as in the pre-computer days. Would the film still hold your interest?

They don't look particularly inventive, the voice talent is often at best distracting, or at worst, poor, and the stories are very sparse.Madagascar really is no exception to the rule. We first meet the heroes of the film - the animals - at the New York Zoo. Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is a zebra bored with captivity and longing for the freedom of the wild. Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) is a vain yet cowardly lion, happy to pose for the public in his cage, and so full of himself that he buys Marty little icons of himself as birthday presents. Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac giraffe, while Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) is an earth momma, keeping her pals in check.There is a also a small mafia of penguins in the zoo who want to go to Antarctica. These are funny and inventive characters, but a little at odds with the rest of the film.This film has its moments - the animals going on the subway to Grand Central Station; the squirrels and chipmunks who rule the island of Madagascar (the wild Marty is so keen on); and the film and TV references - Hawaii Five O, Born Free, Chariots of Fire, American Beauty, and more.But the characters are two-dimensional, the script is needlessly childish (yes, I know it is for kids, but give them some credit for having brains), and the film is pretty pointless, other than the same old 'you've got a friend' theme that pervades almost every film from the studio. The voice talent is just OK (and Ben Stiller in particular makes Alex irritating) and the animation is boring.Not one I'd rush to see again.",

Of course that if you are a serious person and you're looking for a long, thought over plot you have to go and see some other movie, but for me, it did the purpose and it actually surprised me. I went with no expectations to the movie theater (because I've seen Shrek, The Incredibles and Monster's Inc), but the movie did not disappoint me at all and surprisingly, was a lot of fun. Concluding: I enjoyed this movie a lot, laughed a lot and commented all the gags with my friends once I got out of the theater (laughing again of course) and for me, it was a wonderful \"de-stressing\" moment in the evening and I went to bed with a smile.

For us grown-ups, only the penguins were extremely funny, and the rest were smilable but not nowhere in the league of \"Toy Story\", \"A Bug's Life\", \"Robots\", etc. Some spoofs from movies like \"Cast Away\" (the ball), Lion King (the hienas) were functional, and this helped with some humorous bits.

Chris Rock (the best of the main characters), Jada Pinkett-Smith (who has hardly any input), Ben Stiller & David Schwimmer (primarily a one joke character) all struggle with underwritten roles. Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen - Mr. Ali G) & Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer - Not a character name!!) are very enjoyable, but it is the Penguins who, without a doubt steal the movie. The (all too) brief flashes to the penguins are an adrenaline shot in the arm of a flagging movie. This film is only slightly better than the truly awful Sharks Tale, and both films despite having some fantastic set pieces, in-jokes, visual gags & snappy lines, suffer from a lack of emotional investment as we the audience never truly care for the characters, like we did of Woody, Buzz, Nemo, Marlin & the Incredibles. If Dreamworks Animation are really serious about being an equal contender in the 3D (& to a lesser extent 2D) animation market they have got to start spending a lot more time on writing & developing both the story & especially the characters, before throwing (& waisting) wonderful talent & fantastic visuals & occasionally clever gags at these rather lazy, paper-thin stories. I have no doubt that the younger kids will be kept amused and the older crowds should enjoy the odd moment, but your better off waiting for the DVD. Long Live Pixar!",

                "comment": "I've got several animated movies in my private DVD collection, even though I'm no longer a kid. And yes, I always buy them for myself, since I don't have any children (and not planning on having one soon either) or a younger brother or sister. On the other hand, I must also say that I have a rather specific taste. I don't really like the average Disney fairy tale-like movies. I prefer movies like Ice Age, Shrek, The Incredibles,... in which some fine animation is combined with excellent humor. After seeing the trailer for this movie, I was really curious about it. Would it be for children only, or would an adult like me also be able to enjoy it? \"Madagascar\" tells the story of four animals at New York's Central Park Zoo who have lived there all their lives, don't know what life in the wild is like and don't want to know it either... except for Marty the Zebra. When he breaks out of his cage and makes a trip through the center of New York City, his friends Alex the Lion, Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo go after him to get him back. But the humans think that the four escaped because they wanted to go back to the wild and that's why they are put on a boat and sent to a wild reserve in Kenia. However, when their ship is hijacked and their boxes are accidentally thrown over board, they end up on a desolate island where they will experience what life in the wild can be like and how much it differs from what they have known all their lives...Although this movie isn't perfect - especially the last part didn't always do it for me - I must say that I had a good time watching it. The animations for instance are excellent. I like the way the animals look (even though they may perhaps not be as 'perfect' as what you might see when Pixar had made them) and the surroundings are marvelous (New York city, as well as the island). I guess it is just a matter of taste, but in my opinion you can't really compare the different styles of animation. Disney differs from Pixar and Pixar is different when you compare it to Dreamworks. What's wrong with that? If all the animations looked the same, everybody would complain and say that they never try to create their own style and are only copying what works.Next to the animation, I also liked the diversity in the characters. Take for instance Alex. He's the star of the Zoo and he knows it, while Melman is a hypochondriac who always feels sick and Gloria is a huge hippo who clearly doesn't mind about her size. I even liked Marty the zebra, always craving for attention, but not seen as interesting enough by the audience. And those four characters are also joined by some very good sidekicks. Take for instance the penguins who acted like military commando's or the monkeys who act like they have a lot of style, but still do what any other monkey would do. I really liked the diversity in characters and had several good laughs with each of them.When I read the reviews from other viewers, I sometimes can't help smiling. The main reason for that is because some people seem to forget that this is just an animated movie, not a documentary. If you really want to see how these animals live and act, don't you think it would be better that you watch the National Geographic Channel, go to a zoo or go on a safari? I'm sometimes asking myself: Do they think the same about Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote? Or do they really believe that a coyote knows how to work with dynamite and can fall of a 1000 ft. cliff without dying? This is still an animated comedy so I don't care whether the animals look truthful or not (by the way: have you ever seen a monster like Shrek or a talking donkey in real life? I haven't, but that doesn't mean that I can't like them). The same for their comments on the humor or the - in their opinion - lack of it. They believe that the humor in the movie was only good for kids. I'm sorry, but I see that as an insult. I'm an intelligent 27-year old with two college degrees, but I'm still able to laugh with those 'stupid' and 'childish' jokes and the situation humor like for instance Alex falling in a field of cacti. When they see it in a Charlie Chaplin movie or \"Road Runner\", they say it is excellent, but when it is done in an animated movie about some zoo-animals, they no-longer like it. Make up your mind people... All in all this is a movie that will not only appeal to children. The mature audience - it doesn't matter if they go watch it on their own or with kids - will have a good time with it as well. Next to a lot of situation humor, you will also get some fine references to well-known movies, which your children will probably not connect to another movie, but love anyway. My favorite reference was the \"American Beaty\"-scene in which Alex sees steaks falling out of the sky instead of rose leaves. Even though the end wasn't as strong as the biggest part of the movie, I still loved this movie enough to give it a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10. And if that means that I'm an immature man, so be it...",

On one hand, the plot was predictable, the jokes not particularly funny and the speed of the characters movement gave me a headache (they constantly run around and jump and dance). I did like the characters, although they weren't anything new or interesting. David Schwimmer (as the giraffe) made me laugh, but mainly because I could compare the personality of the giraffe to that of Schwimmer's character Ross in the TV show Friends - both a bit paranoid and very cautious at all times. Ali G (as the lemur king) made me giggle as well when he danced, and I particularly liked the 'wackiness' of his character. The penguins were probably the most enjoyable characters on the film - they were \"psychotic\" (as the lion Alex liked to call them) and I found them very entertaining to watch. The animation in this film was very well done. I noticed in particular the perfection on the water effects (eg by the sea in Madagascar or in Gloria's swimming pool) and Alex's mane (how it moves when he does). I would say this film is enjoyable. It isn't anything new or fantastic, but it did have small moments where it made you smile or laugh. Otherwise it got a bit predictable really. My advice - see if you liked Shrek.

More of them would have made a lot of difference (and with the movie's box office returns, the possibility of DreamWorks spinning them off into a TV series shouldn't be ruled out).\"Madagascar\" also trots out some very weak cultural gags, some of which really stick out in what's supposed to be a movie for kids (Alex's \"American Beauty\" dream with roses replaced by steaks, complete with Thomas Newman's original music? A \"Cast Away\" gag with a ball called Spalding? And can someone point out that it might not be a good idea to remind older viewers of better movies from the same company?), and the heavy doses of non-original music just make the new stuff by Hans Zimmer and Co. seem weaker than ever. Add to this animation that's on the same level as \"Father of the Pride\" and a very annoying dosage of \"I Like To Move It,\" and you have one very mediocre animated feature. (How mediocre?

For what seems like months, my daughter and I have been bombarded with Madagascar TV promotions, food promotions, toy adverts and all the usual hoopla associated with a major kids animated movie release. In a way it's similar to the periodic population explosion which is responsible for the lemming suicide myth. Every now and then, the lemming population becomes so large that they migrate en masse, causing some to die as they flock over a cliff. In this case, the media have waiting too long since Dreamworks last animated epic, the disappointing Shark Tale, so with another 2 years to wait for the next Shrek sequel, they have whipped themselves up into a frenzy over Madagascar. But does it deserve the attention?In a word, no. Like Shark Tale, Madagascar doesn't really cut it as a winner. A lack of decent jokes is the main reason why the film fails to grab the attention in the way it should. There are some funny moments involving a trio of cunning penguins who have their own escape plan, as well as some good toilet humour, but the laughs are few and far between. After a while the film develops a vegetarian motif, as Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller) starts to return to his wild instincts and craves zebra meat. This is fairly uncomfortable viewing (though this may be for my own personal reasons), as is the heavy-handed patriotism which seems to inflict many films that centre around New York. David Schwimmer's neurotic giraffe is left to provide most of the comic relief, while Jada Pinkett Smith's hippopotamus might as well not be there. There was something odd about the animation which I couldn't quite place, too. It seemed to be too jerky, with characters hopping about so quickly that it was hard to watch.Madagascar might have the big names and the big studio behind it, but my young daughter wasn't hooked and nor was I.",

Your Kids will love it but you won't. Even that isn't right. I mean kids will enjoy the whole film from start to finish without a doubt but, for me personally, the whole film was missing a storyline. Here you have four animals voiced by four well known actors. Ben Stiller voices Alex the Lion, Chris Rock takes on Marty the Zebra, David \"Ross\" Schwimmer tackles the job of Melman the Zebra and Jada \"Mrs Will\" Smith does a great job with Gloria the hippo. The animation is faultless and the chemistry between the four animals is slick. Each character is his/her own and, with the exception of David Schwimmer's Melman who reminded me far too much of his friends alter-ego Ross, the character voices fit in perfectly. The jokes are of a childish nature but there are a few moments which will get even the most hardened of adults giggling to themselves.(The penguins are great.)Some parts made me question the U certificate. However, I just felt that there could have been more of a story to it. More of a challenge for the four animals. Visually this is great but as a movie it is too short and basic. It doesn't have the same entertainment value as Shrek or Shark Tale but it does have it's good points. If your feeling down or under the weather and you want a feel good movie then give this a try.

In some places you do wonder if the plot is going to develop a bit more, and often it doesn't. however the characters personalities keep the plot going and the character of Melman the giraffe is very funny in places. this films is highly recommended for children and adults alike!!",

This movie is guaranteed to make you laugh at least 10 times. Beautiful comedy, voices of that characters are just outstanding. Team work really made this movie work. This really worked out for a teen crowd, when i watched this the theater was full of teens, and very few children. So this really pulled off a older crowd, and that is wonderful for a animation to be able to attracted the older group as well as the young this was a wonderful movie, and I will watch it again. i recommend this movie for family night, it something the whole family can enjoy",

Even less likely is the chance that you've ever even seen one and/or are familiar with the story and its main character, John Constantine.This is an entertaining movie. It's a very cool story done very well -- regardless of what Hellblazer fans say. I don't care if the movie is true to the comic and I don't care if Keanu Reeves plays the role of Constantine accurately -- and neither should you.Reeves isn't Russell Crowe or Geoffrey Rush. He doesn't have to be -- especially in a movie like this. Much like his work as Neo, he does enough with John Constantine to give the average movie-goer an enjoyable experience. This movie was a pleasant surprise and much better than I thought it would be -- considering the many critics. 8/10",

The film isn't dark or deep enough to be considered along the same lines as the likes of Batman Begins, and at the same time it's not camp or over the top enough to be considered a 'fun' comic book flick. This is one of the main pitfalls for the film, as with this strange placing of the film; it has cut out both of the comic book audiences, and left itself with a film that is as muddled as it's lead actor's acting is weak. The plot seems to jump from one happening to another, often without any kind of explanation or logic. This makes viewing this film a very turgid experience, and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done has also left the movie a good twenty minutes overlong; which only serves in making the film more painful. It's a shame that this film isn't better, as it has a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick. The plot follows John Constantine; a man that can see the demons that live among us. When policewoman Angela Dodson's sister apparently commits suicide, the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native Los Angeles.Keanu Reeves often gets criticised for his acting, and for good reason - he's rubbish. He slinks his way through the film, giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across. The good thing is that a downtrodden character like John Constantine suits him, so it's not as bad as it could have been...but on the other hand, if a talented actor were given the role; the film would have been much better. Keanu's \"Chain Reaction\" co-star, Racheal Weisz joins him again here, and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i.e. just 'appear'. You don't go into a movie like this expecting good acting really; but this film doesn't have even have 'acting'! The only performance I really enjoyed was Peter Stormare in the role of Satan, and that only lasted about five minutes. The special effects are typically dazzling, and while it's not the best CGI of all time; it's imaginatively used and provides the movie with it's main asset. It's a shame that this film is a flop, as the film noir elements of the plot could really have delivered something interesting, the subject of devils and demons always makes for fun viewing; and the recent run of comic book films has been quite impressive...but impressive, this film is not, and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss.",

I liked Reaves' character and again, it's a matter of preference - love or hate - but he played Constantine's miserable demon-cop just right - Reaves continues to find rolls suited to his particular, dark style. Special effects were great, and I give the film kudos for not diving in and becoming an effects extravaganza...it remains online to the story and where we're going...

The exciting, action loaded film follows the continuing saga of dark soul John Constantine, demon hunter. Punished by God to wonder the streets of Earth, for an attempted suicide, he now must 'earn' his way back into the grace of the almighty. To do this, he must hunt down and 'excorcise' every sort of demonic beast that plague's mankind. Aiding him are a host of penitent souls who have sinned and wish to redeem themselves. To make matters worse, is the Archangel Gabriel who want to step up the 'final' conflict and match powers with Lucifer (Peter Stormare) himself. Caught in-between their cosmic battle is Constantine, who must atone for his sin with self-sacrifice and brute power over the army of the dammed.

I also didn't feel that this film tried to beat me over the head with religion. Though, I liked the religious aspects...the demons, the idea of God, the depiction of the angel Gabriel (WOW), the possessions; the exorcisms...the list goes on, were well done. And yes, the depiction of Hell too. Watch it; see for yourself. I know I was surprised, & pleasantly so.

A lot has been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie two stars.

Th highlight of the movie are the special effects, closely followed by the performance of one Rachel Wiesz. A truly captivating performance that had me moved. I can only imagine what it's like to lose a twin sister, but from my personal experiences, I can say that most of the twin talk in the movie is dead on. It helps that I have a couple friends who have either a spouse or siblings who are twins, but what do I know. Anyway the point is Weisz pulls it off effortlessly and should be considered one of the best performances of the year.Not much to say about the special effects except that they are first rate. With so much being done on a computer these days, it's not hard to tell the difference between whats real and a video game. (\"Chronicles of Riddick\" comes to mind when I think of overdone computer-generated special effects.) So in a nutshell, the movie does not suck, is not great, and is somewhere in between. And yes, Keanu Reeves is not a great actor, not even a good actor, but I will still take time to check out his movies. Check out \"Something's Gotta Give --a much better movie-- if you want a good, clean, Keanu performance. As John Constantine he was good, in a dirty, life-sucks kind of way.Lower your expectations a bit and you may enjoy this little nugget of a movie.",

                "comment": "This movie was very interesting I thought. The plot is very confusing but if you pay very close attention then you can understand it. Basically what this movie is about is Heaven and Hell. John Constantine had visions of demons as a child and soon tried to commit suicide, which is considered a mortal sin. However after the attempt doctors revived him. He was dead for 2 minutes and he spent those two minutes in Hell, and basically after seeing how horrible Hell was he never wanted to go back. So in a desperate attempt to buy his way into Heaven, he fights off the demons that are trying to cross over into the real world. The story tells us that there is a demon in every bad man and an angel in every good one. So when the demons attempt to come through, Constantine kills them off. But this still isn't good enough to get into Heaven. In the beginning an angel named Gabriel tells John that he can't buy his way into Heaven. John asks what he can do and Gabriel said self sacrifice. And then she tells him he's f***** which I found funny because she's an angel. But anyway...In the end just before the spawn of Satan is release, Constantine meets the devil. (Quick reminder that Hell wants him) The girl he's been with, Angela, has a sister who did the same thing that John did, committed suicide because of the visions she had. Constantine said that as long as she can go to Heaven instead of Hell, he'll go to Hell with him. However that is considered a self sacrifice and before the Devil can take him, He dies and goes to Heaven...briefly. Satan revives him, say that he's going to keep Constantine on the earth until he shows that he belongs in Hell. Cliffhanger, No? OK well I enjoyed this movie. There could have been more action but it actually was much more a suspenseful movie than it was action or horror. However if that is what Hell is really like I'm afraid to go there too. No folks this is no \"Little Nicky\" Hell. This is a terrifying portrait of Hell. It creeped me out at least.CAST CONSTANTINE: The acting is okay. Keanu Reeves, although I honestly think he could use some acting lessons, is the perfect person to play the part of Constantine. He's not tormented by the things he sees, he almost sees them as playmates. Just more fun. And he does portray that well. 8/10 ANGELA: Rachel Weisz does an okay job in this movie. To be honest I appreciated her role in the mummy more than in Constantine. In the end she just had no effect on me. I wouldn't have care if she died. But she did an okay job in showing how much she cared for her sister, and how much she really wished she could have helped her. 5/10 CHAS: Shia LaBeouf is going to be a big star when he gets older. He becomes a bigger part of this movie towards the end and he didn't really have much to portray, but he plays his part perfectly. An eager kid wanting to be like John Constantine. \"If you're sitting on the bench you gotta be ready to play, right?\" -Best quote in the movie. I was like \"YES! Shia's gonna play a bigger part.\" 9/10 So all in all, good movie that could have used development around the plot points. 7.5/10",

                "comment": "In the tradition of comic book-to-film translations, \"Constantine\" (no, not THAT Constantine) offers very little in the way of plot and just focuses squarely on special effects and such. Also in line with such tradition, it all but completely discards the source material, which in this case are the DC/Vertigo \"Hellblazer\" comics. Though I'm not big on the \"Hellblazer\" series, which have seen their most popular arcs through comic book artist Garth Ennis, I do realize that much is different from the source material, including the fact that morose hard-a** anti-hero John Constantine is British and most of the action of the comics takes place in Liverpool, England.But I'm not here to make comparisons; I'm here to judge a movie. The best thing to be said about \"Constantine\" is that it keeps you watching, not just for the effects and strong visual delight but because it's fantasy - interesting fantasy.In \"Constantine,\" we learn that John Constantine (the effectively wooden Keanu Reeves), is dying of cancer, forbidden from entering Heaven as a result of an attempted suicide (he was clinically dead for two minutes), has a bad attitude, and can see demons yet no one else can. To think that a normal person could see demons you'd have no choice but to declare that person insane, right? Demons and angels, we learn, cannot enter into the human plane of existence but strange occurrences in Los Angeles force Constantine to search for answers after he's attacked in public view by a demon.The plot to \"Constantine\" bears more than a passing resemblance to a past Reeves vehicle (\"The Matrix,\" anyone?), in that as human beings, we are completely oblivious to the truth about our reality. As the film opens, two scavengers in Mexico discover the Spear of Destiny, the weapon rumored to have been used to kill Jesus Christ during the Crucifixion.One of them high-tails it to Los Angeles where the main plot of the film is revealed. Isabel Dodson, the twin sister of Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), commits suicide. Angela, the dogged detective she is, disbelieves the official story because she knows her sister was a devout Catholic and would never commit suicide, as such an act would require eternal damnation in Hell.The special effects are nonstop, and there is one effective and horrific sequence where Constantine ventures to Hell, which is in all respects, a darker vision of Los Angeles except it's a place where demons and the damned roam. With the help of his legion of otherworldly allies, who include normal human Chas (Shia LaBeouf), a half-breed named Midnite (Djimon Hounsou), appropriately named Father Hennessey (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton), Constantine and Angela race against time to stop a nefarious plot waged by the forces of Hell that could bring about the apocalypse.The plot, if you want to call it that, is pretty non-existent and Reeves is pretty wooden as usual but let's face it, nobody in this cast is going to get Oscars come next spring. The film drags for about the first 20 minutes or so but becomes more engaging as it goes through its motions. Director Francis Lawrence (of music video infamy, which accounts for the dizzying camera-work) does his best, but somehow or another the film can't really seem to get it together when it comes to certain parts of the script.For example, it's not really sure what it wants to be: a horror movie, fantasy, thriller, what? It's not really sure and I'm not really sure of what it wants to do. Such items shouldn't plague the viewer but it does, to me, play out a lot like a mish-mash of all three.As the anti-hero chain smoker John Constantine, Reeves' wooden acting is effective (is there any other way to play such a character?) and as the film progresses you can tell he's really suffering inside, as he grows sicker and sicker from cancer. And we also believe his desperation as he tries to send half-breeds to Hell in order to get back on God's good side so he can enter Heaven when he dies. In his character, we also get our fair share of Pentagrams and demonic spells and chanting and such. The opening sequence alone brings back uncomfortable memories of \"The Exorcist\" (1973).\"Constantine\" may win over die-hards of the \"Hellblazer\" and people may or may not get a kick out of Peter Stormare as an Armani-wearing Satan. Like Neo says, \"Whoa.\"6/10",

So what happened? Director Francis Lawrence should stick to his prior experience with making music videos. After the first few minutes of this tired and monotonous script (deliver in tired monotonous bland monotone by Reeves) you know you should just switch it off. But then come monsters emerging from the neck of a young girl undergoing exorcism, silly discovery of a lost spear by a border-crossing Mexican peasant in front of whom all animal life dies, suicides, 'up pops a new monster' episodes etc etc. The apparent struggle between good and evil forces seems it may have been the impetus for this overblown mess, but others have done it better - many, many, many times ad infinitum.

By doing this he is trying to work his way back on the path to Heaven. Why he was brought back is not known but he has the ear of both Heaven (Gabriel) and Hell. Now, too many demons are crossing over and Constantine believes the Devil is up to something not agreed to with God.The title of this could have been The Spear of Destiny as some believe that Christ died when he was speared by the Roman soldier. Whoever holds this spear controls the world. The spear was lost, of course, and found for this movie. It's impact was short lived and it's easier to name a sequel Constantine 2, rather than the Spear of Destiny 2. You may remember Constantine, but not the short lived spear that really didn't have the impact I thought this story would give it. This story was too much concerned with sending demons back to Hell. I think the sequel will have more to do with the Spear of Destiny. I can't wait. Can you? If the sound on my DVD version was any better I might have enjoyed this more. Sometimes it was very difficult to make out what a character said. You would think that a little rewind to go over the audio again and again would have helped, but it didn't' the countless times I rewound. Those who watched this in a movie theater really must have gone crazy with \"what did he say?\" But, I got the idea and that is enough, I suppose. Maybe I just had a bad DVD. Maybe.However, everything was good, the acting was good, the cinematography was outstanding and a few demons startled me when I least expected it. Those I heard clearly wouldn't you know. The story got more complicated when Lucifer arrives on the scene near the end, almost like it was another story entirely and I got lost for a moment (sound, remember?) or two, but I got the idea, I think, maybe. Now, if I told you why he appeared that would not be any fun.But, all in all, not bad. Not scary, and the suspense was not really there for a suspense movie.

I've seen laBoef in a few other films such as I, Robot (bit part) and Holes. (i think that was him). and he really showed potential in I, Robot to be the next smooth talking actor on the big screen. like Colin Farell cos he sounds like he is confident and he is realistic with the way he acts. this boy has a great deal of potential and talent. he shud go far. but the film is entertaining in parts like the computer effects and the bath scene but everything else went out the window. literally. there was many plot holes. very much disappointing but it is worth the watch if ur into the Gothic tales of hell and the devil. 6 out of ten for the graphics",

Despite his careless attitude, Constantine is forced to help in earth's darkest hour.This kind of role for Keanu just does not work for me.

The acting award for this film definitely goes to Weisz, despite looking nothing like a cop (especially from New York City).The producers obviously use the great special effects to cover up the sub-par acting and pitiful story. There is nothing worse to me as a movie lover than to see a comic book film fail to seem anything like a comic strip, which Marvel has been so successful in doing the past few years (With exception of Fantastic Four and The Hulk).

CONSTANTINE is one of these movies. It's easily (too easily) the worst movie of 2005, but it's also a strong contender for the worst movie of the last 5 years. Before you dismiss me as a Keanu Reeves hater, know that I love (and own on DVD) the full Matrix trilogy (yes, even Revolutions) and My Own Private Idaho, definitely his best role to date. I'm also a big horror movie fan. So all in all I was really excited when I went to see that film. The trailer was awesome, I couldn't wait! The film starts well, I mean the first 5 to 10 minutes. It's all downhill from there, culminating in the most unexciting climax of all time, with Peter Stormare as the most ridiculous and non-threatening Satan ever. Keanu Reeves kind of proves his naysayers right by offering one of his most awful and wooden performances ever, on a par with his \"work\" in Brad Stoker's Dracula, but worse, as in that movie he didn't have such a long time on screen. Here, he's there constantly, non-playing. Ewww. Rachel Weisz is good (as always), but not enough to save the film. I lost any interest whatsoever after half an hour, and the only reason I didn't leave the theater was that I didn't want to be rude to my mate, who I had dragged to see this. I thought maybe he was enjoying it. However, when the stupid and absolutely unexciting climax happened, I turned to him and asked \"Are you enjoying this?\" He replied \"Are you kidding??\" \"Should we leave then?\" did I ask... \"It's almost over, we might as well stay\". Well we shouldn't have. The ending was as bad as the rest of the movie. Oh, for those of you who think \"it might not be fantastic, but I'll watch it for the special effects\"... a word of warning: the CGI looks like a cheap video game, absolutely not realistic. Rent it if you must, but don't make a blind buy, you will regret it bitterly!",

Even so this film was even worse of a hell than the one Constantine visited. I can't think of worse adaptation then League Extraordinary Gentlemen. but the this film wasn't based on the Hellblazer comics but \"Inspired\" by them. Keanu Reeves yet again acts like hes a block of wood then a sentient being, which, in action flicks or comedies is fine, but come on for Constantine it just doesn't work. It seems the character has had his entire personality stripped away and even his nationality. In the comics ( I know, I know I said I'd judge it as an original idea than based on the Hellblazer comics but unfortunately I can't) John Constantine is a complete asshole but here in the movie the worst I can remember him doing is not holding the elevator door open for someone. As well as that Chas is his best friend not his lackey. I suppose I can look away at the character not being British but not the fact that he uses a gun shaped out of a crucifix. I can keep going and going and going but then nobody would read this comment so I'll wrap it up quickly by saying that the makers of this movie seemed to have taken the whole complexity, depravity and wit of the Constantine universe and characters and raped them repeatedly. They then diluted the essence of them down enough so that they appeal to the most amount of people and come out at the end with a standard piece of clich\u00e9d action garbage. Once more Alan Moore must sit by and watch one of his creations take a beating by movie execs. I'm just glad that he decided to distance himself entirely from this movies making as the end result is pitiful. But really it's very easy to point out the mistakes of others with the advantage of afterthought. So my one good thing to say about this film was that they had the stones to make it and really my comment doesn't matter,or anybody else's, see for yourself whether it's good or not and screw anybody who tries to force you to see it there way. If you think its good I won't hold it against you",

                "comment": "Okay, so here's my typically film-student critique of this movie. I'm not going to just bash it without giving good examples and saying what I would've done to change it if only I'd written the damned screenplay.Problem # 1: Tone. It's a movie about Heaven and Hell and demons on earth and the apocalypse. A good director and writer could've really done this movie justice by making it darker, excluding the cute, witty one liners and quirks and going for the R-rated brutality of its theme. I don't totally blame the director for this: there were some interesting moments I give him credit for and some great mise-en-scene choices (devil in a white suit--classic); a little too much CGI for my taste and not enough left to the imagination, but I think he did his best, to no avail. My point is, a perfectly good excuse to use the darker, more serious tone that would've suited this concept was squandered, and my two hours were bruised because of it. Problem #2 (a more obvious problem): wasted time on too many characters and repeated actions. This movie could've saved precious time by combining characters--thereby allowing us to understand and get to know them better--and by not having 25 trips to hell and 7 exorcisms (don't say \"Nuh uh\"--I'm exaggerating). Here's what I mean by combining characters: the priest, the bowling alley guy and the annoying sidekick all could've been made into one character, the \"sidekick/researcher\" character who does all the things these three do for the plot without weighing it down with three separate characters. Also, Balthazar and Gabriel could've been combined to form a singular \"tangible threat\" character; Gabriel could've easily done all the things Balthazar did without having to splinter into two separate characters. Why wasn't this done to prevent the chaos of too many meaningless flat characters with five-minute parts and deaths that came before you could even give a crap about them? Because of Problem # 3... Which is this: Constantine shouldn't have been an adaptation of the comic. It should've been based on the comic. What's the difference? It's the difference between O Brother Where Art Thou (a film based on Homer's Odyssey) and Troy (a poor adaptation of Homer's Iliad). A film based on a book or comic has more creative freedom to know which characters or events do or don't work for the film, to make changes, to deviate. The screenwriter made the mistake of thinking he had to adapt this comic to film, and thereby assuming that this meant he had to squeeze an entire comic book series and all its coolest characters into a 2-hour frame, necessity and plot be damned. That said, I'm not totally mad at this movie. Keanu gave one of his biggest efforts at acting ever (some will snort that that isn't saying much). Plus, every time I see Djimon Honsou smile I have this Pavlovian response that makes me say \"I like him\". And Peter Stormare made the most original devil I've seen in a while, with his wonderfully creepy mannerisms and discomfiting presence (funny thing: the first time I saw him in Fargo in a scene after he kills a cop, I said \"That man is the devil--in a real good way\"). So to wrap it up, here's my solution: some writers need a license to adapt comic books. Then maybe we'd have more Sin City's and Crow's and less Constantine's.",

The plot is *much* richer, the special effects are equal, and the acting is certainly better.Keanu in particular does an excellent job. His down-beat portrayal of the depressed, chain-smoking, wise-cracking, cynical tool-of-god character is spot on. This is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, people! Almost every scene has a touch of dark humor that makes it clear the movie (and Keanu) are not taking themselves too seriously. It appears reviewers have completely ignored this, and want to see it as a standard horror film, which it is not.I was very pleasantly surprised at how watchable the film (DVD) was, chuckled many times at the dark Catholic humor, and enjoyed Keanu's performance.

                "comment": "Just when you thought comic-book movies couldn't get anymore crazy and over-cooked, along comes Constantine to raise the bar again. There appears no limit to the ability of comic book - excuse me, graphic novel - writers to concoct wacko scenarios out of random bits of pop culture flotsam (a little Exorcist here, a little Chandler there, a dash of Batman); and there also appears no limit to the willingness of movie studios to exploit the supposed built-in audience for this kind of dark, freakish crap. On the surface it would seem a good strategy, taking works from one graphic medium and translating them into another, but the problem is that there's more to making good movies than just morphing comic-book frames into film images. It takes more than graphic style to make good movies, a fact that becomes painfully clear when watching something like Constantine, a film that's as mind-numbing in the playing out of its story as it is impressive in its visual design.The story isn't told so much as pounded into your brain. The protagonist, John Constantine, is one of these messed-up comic book anti-heroes, a guy who, if he weren't saving the world, he'd be off paying shrinks hundreds of dollars an hour to help him get over whatever childhood traumas were responsible for his being a sullen, chain-smoking wreck. As if Constantine's life weren't bad enough, he discovers that the earth is about to be beset by the minions of Satan's Son, and wouldn't you know it, he's the only one who can rescue humanity from this supernatural scourge. Or almost the only one. There happens to be another supernaturally-gifted character, a female cop named Angela (played by the always-succulent Rachel Weisz), except that Angela is in denial about her psychic gifts, not to mention being aggrieved over the recent suicide of her twin sister. Around these two complex-ridden characters swirls a world of pat comic-book duality, a world where heaven's representatives seek to balance the mischief carried out by the spawn of Hell - the kind of morally black-and-white world beloved of our two favorite Georges, Bush and Lucas. Not that you would expect moral complexity in a comic-book movie - it's not that easy to sell ambiguity to the masses (House of Sand and Fog was not a hit, in case you didn't notice). And neither would you expect restraint from a movie whose purpose is to sell itself as hard as it can to an audience made-up mostly of jaded action-movie fans, the kind of people who find Spider Man a little slow.Constantine gives these graphic novel drones everything they could want and more: angels and devils, swarms of winged demons, visualizations of Hell where the world looks like Hiroshima at the point of the explosion. What distinguishes the film is the outrageous extent it goes to in exploiting people's enduring fascination with religious imagery, paraphernalia and ideas. The Exorcist was once the last word in religious porn, but Constantine has usurped it. John Constantine is trying to buy his way into heaven after being condemned to Hell for committing suicide; Angela's sister Isabel was a devout Catholic whose soul is damned because she jumped off a building; Constantine's buddies are a psychic-priest and some other squirrelly guy who lives in a bowling alley and deals in rare religious artifacts (he has a copy of the extended bible, the one normally only found in Hell). It's hard, seeing how insistent the film is in selling its rather pornographic version of religion, not to be a little unsettled (especially when you consider how well this kind of stuff tends to go over with people who consider themselves religious), but it's not really crassness that does the picture in, it's plain-old Hollywood shoddiness. For all its outward gall the movie is rather pedestrian, the storytelling rather flaccid. The surface may be brimming with imagination, but underneath is the same old save-the-world jive, the same old comic-book hokum.You might expect a little infusion of charm from Keanu Reeves, an actor who is normally at least watchable, but the sound and fury of Constantine so drowns-out his laid-back personality that he's reduced to a video game character, a dully enigmatic figure marching grimly through level after level of computer-generated carnage. This isn't the kind of movie that emphasizes the personality of an actor, and it isn't the kind that goes for much sex-appeal either, as evinced by the fact that Keanu and Rachel Weisz, two of the hotter people on the planet, manage to generate about zero sexual spark (which is about as much as Keanu had with Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix Trilogy). The producers of this kind of movie seem almost contemptuous of the idea of any spontaneous human quality, erotic or otherwise, breaking through the over-designed, over-sold surfaces of their commodity-films. To let actors fling off the kind of nervous, quirky energy that makes for good viewing would represent a threat to the machine-tooled product, so we end up with performances so two-dimensional, so styled to fit in with the overall visual scheme, that one wonders why actors are employed at all. Don't directors care about what people like Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz can bring to a film? I guess that's a silly question given the kind of money that's on the line with a movie like Constantine - the kind of money that precludes the possibility of any messy humanity being allowed to get in the way.",

It would appear that the Roman Catholic church has a monopoly on things Divine and Hellish. Having usurped Latin as the fashionable way to portray superiority in such matters Constantine fights the good fight against the demons of darkness with his all too fanatical Catholic sidekick (Rachel Weisz) who just so happens to be a powerful psychic. He also smokes too much and seems to be near death. Without giving anything away, it seems that this film wants to be anti-smoking whilst at the same time gives credence to the singularity of the church of Rome.The message from this film, for me, is simple. Avoid being Roman Catholic and you will avoid Hell/demons/burning/perdition/damnation you name it.

Why, because he attempted suicide as a young man and according to this movie that means a one way trip to hell no matter how good you are. Well Constantine is not exactly an angel either, even though he performs exorcisms and such. Well a spear has been uncovered and the demons are doing things differently...Constantine must pair with a cop whose twin sister has committed suicide in order to find out the deal. Action and special effects abound aplenty in this movie with some pretty good action and a few doses of horror in there just for safe measure.

Perhaps a direct relation can be made to relapsed catholics and moderate Christians. I found the story interesting even though I know of more extreme constituencies that would readily claim to be offended by everything portrayed within the movie.It speaks to the daily struggle that believers have to reconcile modern lifestyles with their fledgling faith and their own state of health and mind. Even though the believer's reality is cast in a more literal, exaggerated form, the main points are not lost in my opinion. Here are some of the important ones: No one great or small should claim to know the true will or pretend to understand God. If they cross that threshold where they truly believe they have a personal understanding of God and His wishes, they are rightly deemed to be quite mad and should be confined to a small padded room as soon as possible. No exceptions.There is a purpose and direction in everyone's lives. Death is not necessarily the final goal or destination.Attentions are still bestowed upon us all on an individual basis even while globular events both bad and good are occurring all the time. The individual pieces of the world mosaic are not overlooked or forgotten. An accounting will inevitably be made of each of us because that is the way of this world. If we allow the fear of personal failures to overwhelm our lives and let addictions however insidiously fixate us to the point of complete immobility, the cost may still be our very soul.The waves will still smash down on the beaches regardless of who is still within them or on top of them.

It's difficult to understand how the man who gave us the charm of E.T. and the humanity of Close Encounters could deliver such pathetic junk. The biggest problem in this film is a script so lacking in coherency that it's writing seems better suited to one of those bad 50's B sci-fi movies. (I think I just heard H. G. Wells roll around in his grave for the umpteenth time.)The other big problem is the lack of empathy one feels for the characters. Cruise's daughter is so annoying I almost wished one of the tripods would put that screeching presence out of her misery. And what's with Tim Robbins? His hammy performance was the only true bit of humor to be found anywhere.Granted, the special effects are great and one should not expect any big statement on the human condition from big budget sci-fi, but we're talking Spielberg here. One anticipates not only a good show but a superior narrative from a good storyteller. On the positive side, the director goes for a much grittier look (a la Saving Private Ryan) which is appropriate for the subject matter. However, maybe the movie would have worked better had it expanded the story to involve more characters and encompassed more the broader effect of the invasion outside of Cruise's family.All in all, a total waste of talent and an even clunkier mess than the marauding invading aliens.",

The only trace of the actual book that has overtaken their determination to tribute it's first movie incarnation is the change of the Martian machines from flying lampshade type things to actual tripods. Other then that the entire film is just an attempt to put a marginally different perspective on the 50's version.To be fair, it does start out well (and there are some good cinematic moments throughout). Some claim it continues well for about 2/3rds of the film, but I think in truth it is only the first 3rd that works at all. It doesn't take long for clich\u00e9s and overly predictable plot elements to creep in and there is nothing daring or risky about anything attempted by Spielberg after about 20 minutes in. It's all very well for people to go on about the focus on the main Character. But I don't think that is particularly groundbreaking. There are a good number of other directors I think can bring off a personal perspective much better so I don't think Spielberg is even playing to his strengths on this one.Plus, when you have an astronomical budget, one major star and material a good 80% of the audience will already know pretty well (anyone not know how it was going to end?), it pretty much goes without saying that people are going to want to see a lot more of the invading martians. It's all very well to point to the rules of good horror and claim not seeing stuff is suspenseful but is it entirely appropriate for this particular film? I would say not. If Spielberg wanted to do a film like that, why not come up with something fresh rather then doing a remake of a well known film based on a well known book. When you already know what is going on, there is nothing gained by not showing it.The film didn't need to worry about action clich\u00e9s as in actual fact this film should never have been an action film. Humanity can't defend against these invaders, so why show anything but futility. Perhaps because that wouldn't be very Hollywood, and for all the good intentions of the film it descended into pretty standard action by the end anyway.What I would have liked to have seen would have been more dramatic spectacles, barren landscapes, shocking scenes of destruction, etc. More of the martians and perhaps show how the governments totally failed to stop them with everything they tried. They actually achieved that in the 40's film, so one of the things Spielberg did leave out was the one aspect that really gave the \"not killed by man\" aspect. As a result the very end leaves you cold, and as a big slap in the face to the book they include a voice over copied directly from the 50's film putting everything in a religious point of view (the one thing that really let down the 40's film). The book was to a large extent very anti-religious and there was no need to ignore that very important aspect of the original story. It's not even comfortably put on the end, because with the (totally unnecessary) heroic triumphs achieved by Cruise minutes early it seems like we've suddenly cut to the end of a different film.Perhaps the influence of the 50's film was too much for him. After all, anyone ever notice how similar ET looks to the aliens in the 50's film? If you were to take those aliens and make them cute, you'd end up with ET. Certainly not a co-incidence. This is very much Spielberg remaking what must have been his favourite film.One thing with Spielberg I always found annoying is his obsession with getting certificates that let kids see the film. For a start no other director could release films like this and like Jurassic park (where someones arm is ripped off his body) and get such family orientated ratings. But even with his ability to manipulate censors, he still has to hold back from making what the film should have been just for the sake of letting the kiddies see it. I guess at the end of the day it's all about money and ego and not just about making a really good film.So there you go. I gave this a disappointing 4 out of 10. It had a lot of potential but there are so many flaws and so many mixed up ideas that are never fully realised I just couldn't give it a good score. I couldn't even give it an average score, because with Spielberg, Cruise and the special effects budget I have to compare it to what I think should have been possible with the money spent and talent involved. This film is one of the great underachiever of the modern day. Compare that to the 50's film, which for the time period had stunning effects, a compelling plot and flaws that were all to understandable given the time of filming. It way ahead of it's time and is still a reasonable watch even five decades later. Can anyone honestly say this will last so well?",

Nothing was cartoonish or fakish. However, a movie can't be saved by its looks. Tom Cruise plays, for once, not Tom Cruise. Instead he plays a boorish and unintelligent Tom Cruise. No panache, no style. Not enough attention is payed to Miranda Otto, who was so riveting in \"The Two Towers\" and \"The Return of the King\". The kids are irritation personified. It's as if Spielberg wanted to show the world how an invasion affected a stereotype of the common family. If this is the common family, we're in trouble. A father who doesn't deliver the necessary skills to his children, or give them expectations to achieve; kids who don't pay attention to authority figures; a crazy Tim Robbins whose character's actions, and final outcome, are pointless to moving us through the story. There wasn't enough horror in this flick. Here we have a filmmaker who has redefined what can be done with film, i.e \"Jaws\" and \"Schindler's List\", who has a chance to do it yet again with a classic story of alien invasion, to truly scare us and make us think, and instead, we get tripe. No spoiling here unless I'm not opaque enough, but there is such a cop out, a deus ex machina, in the end of the movie that my impression was that Spielberg mistakenly assumed that the movie was horrific enough for the viewer to that point. I thought \"The War of the Worlds\" was too long and focused on people we can't really care about because their characters were developed in the wrong directions.",

As other comments mentioned, one cannot really believe this is the director who gave us the second, third and fourth degree encounter movies; or Minority Report; or even ET... something is lacking. In fact, so many things are lacking !!! the Spielberg vision. The Spielberg \"hand\". All what was left from his previous movies is the blond-haired misunderstood child who now becomes hysteric and overreacts. A good script. A story well put together. you can name the rest, the list is open. Instead, we have Tom Cruise displaying his usual acting style: running, screaming, and playing the hero for two hours which seem never-ending.... What a pity, Tom !!! what a difference compared to your performance in Minority Report , or Magnolia, or Collateral....you were really acting in these movies....what happened now ? I did not expect to see extraordinary special effects. we have seen to many of these already. But this movie is even worse than Independence Day. That one at least had some humour. Sadly, War of the Worlds is a huge disappointment. Hollywood, please, no more alien invasions, no more dinosaurs, no more sword-and-sandal epics, no more Delta Force actions, no more disasters and tragedies(we see too many of them on CNN and Real TV, thank you very much). How about some real movies ? about real people, real life, real small-time everyday average lives of ordinary people? like the good old movies of the '80s and '90s ?",

The previous Spielberg/Cruise picture Minority Report, while unsuccessful in the box office was a solid film with a good story and great effects. This one however was aimed at a much bigger audience, being based on such a famous novel. Basing films on famous books is a brave move and often it backfires as u have to pay more attention to detail to keep the fan boys happy, however i didn't know the story so went into this with an open mind trying not to be influenced by the critics.The first hour of this film went really well, it sucked you in to the plight of Cruise and his Kids on there mission to get away from the awe inspiring Tripods, the effects were brilliant the acting solid and the pace of the film relentless, although there were a few mistakes involving EMP(you'll know what i mean if you watch it), i found myself getting involved with the film, Spielberg is a master at this. However the second half is not so good, packed with schmaltz galore and the pointlessness of Tim Robbins character, combined with a completely flat ending made the first half a waste of time building up to a massive disappointment.Maybe instead of a remake, a film based around aliens invading the earth, with which war of the worlds was an obvious template and paying respects to the original would have sufficed.",

You have the big scene in the beginning where the first aliens arrive, and that is how the movie should have been situated. After that there should have been a solution to how to stop the invaders. It didn't even live up to the name of War of the Worlds. This whole thing was one sided. It was very entertaining, I'll grant that, but for a Spielberg movie, I was a little disappointed.

I didn't care so much about the EMP nits, but as we approach oil scarcity, I'm disturbed by the message that we must do ugly things to each other to survive. Ray isn't a bad guy, and he has his talents, but he survives by his ability to focus strictly on the survival of himself and his family. So he steals a car, probably the only working car in the vicinity, to escape. I might have done the same, but as they drove by all those people milling around their stopped cars, I was thinking, \"At least tell them to take cover!\" I had read about the situation with Ogilvy, but my wife also had a bad feeling as soon as they ducked into the cellar. So we waited for the confrontation. Spielberg didn't let Ray kill Olgilvy in fury or the heat of immediate threat, but with a certain premeditation, as in, \"This guy's gotta go before he does anything else to jeopardize my daughter.\" I suppose what bothers me is that people are already all too willing to lie, cheat and steal to prosper in a civilized situation.

Rachel and Robbie come to stay with him for the usual few days and none of them are particularly happy to see one another. However their visit is livened up by an intense electromagnetic storm that is powerful, exhilarating and exciting. What nobody could have known though is that the storms are only cover for an invasion of an alien species, after all, the chances must be a million to one of such an event. As the alien craft rise out of the ground and begin cutting an unstoppable swath across the world, Ray takes his children and flees the city \u0096 not sure where he is going but just hoping to survive long enough to work something out.With the names involved in this film you could be forgiven for expecting something more than just a blockbuster film and, in some ways you'd be right but then in almost as many ways you'd be wrong. In many ways this is better than a normal effects blockbuster, but mainly this is down to the fact that, since 9/11, few studios want to launch a massive film that takes pleasure in death and destruction in the way that Independence Day did. Instead this is much darker and more effective for it \u0096 scarier and tension than if it had been made with just spectacle in mind. It still delivers the goods in that regards but the effects are used well, producing scenes of destruction as well as a particularly impressive scene where the camera moves around a moving car in a way that would be impossible without computers.The downbeat and dark presentation suggested that there is more to this film that effects and I was tempted to look into the subtext as I watched it. Here I didn't find much of interest and perhaps I was trying to see things that weren't there. With the obvious awareness of real events and emotions, the film seems to promote \"everyman for himself\", sacrificial heroics and other strange meanings that the film can't do anything with. Maybe I was expecting too much and really there wasn't anything below the surface but if there was then it didn't make a great deal of sense. Ignoring this aspect though, the film still works well enough as a dark \"alien invasion\" film that entertains and thrills without letting the audience actually revel in or remain remote from the death and destruction.Spielberg keeps it moving well and gives the film an convincing feel; darkness and light are used well and the locations are good, certainly making for a nice change from us watching the usual landmarks being destroyed \u0096 his focus is more on the people and real communities. For most of the film he manages to avoid the mawkish sentimentality that invades many of his films but he gives it up right at the end; the final few minutes had me walking out of the cinema shaking my head. I'm not referring to the bacteria ending (everyone knew that was coming) but to the terrible family reunion scene that is so horribly corny and cheesy that it turned my stomach. Did we need it? It smelt like a tacked on ending from a test screening but part of me knows that Spielberg is probably as guilty as anyone. For such a dark and destructive film it was a terrible ending and the previous 110 minutes deserved much better.Cruise is pretty good but he is far from being the ordinary working Joe that the script asks him to be. He can do the action stuff well and he is well practiced in acting alongside special effects but he is not a New Jersey shoreman! Fanning is as good as ever, convincing in her emotions but again perhaps a bit too precious to be a \"real\" child. Chatwin is OK as Robbie but his character made very little sense to me and he didn't seem to understand what significance he played either. The support cast are mostly screaming extras; Robbins is quite good but Robinson and Barry's cameos are minimised by the fact that they are involved in that terrible, terrible ending. As with all blockbusters, the effects are the stars and they are worthy of the billing.Overall this is a good summer film that has a post-9/11 darkness and tone to it that some might find not quite conducive to enjoying the bangs that the summer audience usually want. However I quite liked this approach and found it more engaging and impacting. The effects are good and the performances fit in with them well but be warned \u0096 the cloying sentimentality of the last few minutes is really hard to stomach and will leave you with a really bad aftertaste.",

This updated H.G. Wells story starts out with a divorced crane operator named Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) who has his children for the weekend while their mother Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) heads to Boston to see her grandparents.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Ray's children are Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and they naturally have a problem being with their immature father but all that changes with what appears to be the start of a lightening storm and lightening hitting key areas on the ground. To everyone's shock alien spacecraft has been buried underground for an unknown amount of time and now they've come to the surface and started to disintegrate everyone (and everything) in their path! Ray and his kids head out of town in what may be the only working car (for the time being) and soon figure out that the planet Earth is under attack. Ray is trying to head to Boston to find his ex-wife but along the way he loses the car to rioters and also meets a strange survivalist named Harlan Ogilvy (Tim Robbins) who ends up being more of a threat than actual help.Spielberg grew up in the 1950's and like many others has fond memories of not only the numerous sci-fi movies that were made but of the \"scare\" films involving \"duck and cover\" that young students were forced to view. Spielberg uses many elements of both the original film and Wells own story in the script such as the look of the tripod ships and the red weed. Like many other of his efforts Spielberg incorporates the theme of a troubled home into the story and when Cruise isn't trying to stay alive from an alien invasion he's desperately attempting to keep some sort of semblance of a family unit together. For the most part I was entertained by what I viewed on screen and both Cruise and Fanning give pretty good performances but I have to be honest and say that I wasn't overwhelmed by anything I saw. There were a few things that irked me (to some degree) and the first has to do with what the aliens intentions are concerning humans. They disintegrate people but they also use them for their blood...can't they make up their alien minds on what they want us for? Before I even went to the theater I instinctively knew I would be disappointed by the appearance of the actual aliens and I was but I did feel a chill whenever the giant tripods made that mechanical bellowing sound. I also had to laugh when I saw how much terror and trauma Cruise's character goes through in this film because regardless of what he has been saying in the media about prescription drugs and psychiatry I thought his character definitely needed to be put on anti-depressants and to see a good shrink! Fanning's character looks so shaken that I expect her to spend the rest of her life in a rubber room in the hospital sucking her thumb in the fetal position. But jokes aside, this is an entertaining effort that hits enough good notes to give it a recommendation and though it's more in line with \"Independence Day\" than something classic like \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" this is still (generally) a fun film to view.",

                "comment": "The past week, I've read in many places (not even sure where at this point) negative opinions on this film focusing on unimportant details, like whether the force fields the aliens use were incorrectly off or on at crucial moments. Or that they're tired of Morgan Freeman's voice as God (he's not God; he speaks of God and could just be a survivor recalling this event years later; and now we're discussing this detail and missing the big picture). I get the feeling some viewers cheat themselves of a strong movie experience by looking for stuff like this throughout a film. The feeling Spielberg conveys in the first few minutes is that this really is just another typical day, as seen from the perspective of Tom Cruise's character and his kids (where it will remain for the entire film). There's nothing ominous in the air (even the TV blips of strange weather project nothing bad). It's a day like last week and it will end as just another day. There's that sameness to everything which all of the audience can relate to. Day after day, week after week, even year after year - nothing to really get excited about.When it shifts, it's a jolt. It starts with that weird lightning, pauses for a few minutes to build more tension, and then escalates to Hell on Earth within a few more. If one were to describe one of those alien tripod machines moving past a couple of blocks away, blasting with it's death beam, it would probably elicit a laugh from listeners, but there's nothing funny about how it's depicted, to Spielberg's credit; he'd learned his craft in this regard by the time of Saving Private Ryan's beach scene. When Cruise peers around the corner, a small, almost mouse-like figure, a lucky survivor of the initial onslaught, all you feel is his fear, his shock, his helplessness. The tripods even produce a bizarre musical sound, a deadly counterpoint to the notes we heard in \"Close Encounters\" produced by Spielberg's friendly aliens; here, the aliens are sounding the death-knell of the human race. I must confess I'm not sure this intensity will come across so well on a small TV screen; I saw this in a theater and they turn up the sound so high, a person walking to his car across the screen is intense.So you're with Cruise and his kids the rest of the film; all your neighbors are dead; your other relatives in other cities? Maybe. You don't know. Any minute now, you may be joining the hundreds dead. No, must be thousands. Millions? No, it's too insane, too dreadful! The first act, ending with Cruise walking back to his house, numb and covered in the dust of people, and then managing to escape in the only working vehicle, is the best sequence; Spielberg can't really top it. But, the next few scenes all come pretty close in a series of heart-stoppers. The one extended scene where Spielberg, Cruise, the writer and all the participants were at a loss was being holed up with Tim Robbins; it just didn't work and slowed the picture down. And the ending? The undoing of the aliens followed along the same lines of the original climax of H.G.Wells' novel and the '53 film version. The filmmakers simply couldn't find a way to trump Wells (one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time) and why should they? The alternative is the aliens win, mankind is dead - that's another film (here, we stop at about a billion dead). But, I didn't agree with Spielberg's reverting to his usual safety net and letting the audience off the hook by miraculously saving the son (ok, there's always a chance he could have survived, but this was a set-up). This was a war, perhaps the most terrible war, and people don't just pop up without a scratch after something like this, unless it's a, well, a Spielberg-type movie. Spielberg, Spielberg, even when you got it - for 90% of the film - you lose it in the end. Now let's all hug each other and wish away any more possible alien attacks. Sigh.",

                "comment": "CONTAINS SPOILERS War of the Worlds is a semi-intelligent, new take on an old genre. Whereas films in the past tend to focus on heroic bloodshed or the right people in the right place saving the day, here we have a far more intimate and realistic perspective: the American families involved don't head off to discover their amazing flying skills over the course of two hours, they run away in terror, each man, woman and child constantly battling with his or her inner demon's, weakness and fear, something which is probably best represent by Cruise's son suggesting that the Smiler himself is merely looking for his ex-wife to pawn his children off on her.Whether this is true or not is an avenue left unexplored and this detracts from the film a great deal. War of the World's emotional heart, like many Spielberg movies, is either on its sleeve or invisible. Examples include Jurassic Park where the only emotions Richard Attenborough was allowed to express were child like enthusiasm, child like fear, child like anguish and child like cynicism when it is suggested that he might have made a teensy weensy mistake in creating an island full of giant carnivores.However, unlike Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds fails to screw the tension into the unbearable levels of previous Spielberg epics. When, for example, Attenborough's grand children (or is he their granduncle?) are being pursued by Raptors through the kitchens in Jurassic Park it is as tense a moment as can be imagined, expertly drawn out with many false dawns and dramatic reverses. The consummate skill shown in making that and other scenes made Jurassic Park one of the greatest and most successful films ever (the prefix 'Greatest' is purely in a popcorn, summer blockbuster sense).On the other hand... when a giant, snake like head goes poking around in War of the Worlds, in a scene that seems remarkably tacked on at the last minute, the tension is more 'Why are they doing that?' than 'Please don't die! Oh God, I can't look...!' Tim Robbin's character feels like little more than an excuse to present the darker side of human interactions. Instead of Cruise's rushing around to return his children to their mother we have a long, drawn out scene which makes little sense (Signs style incompetent, unobservant, they-can-cross-the-void-of-space-but-they-can't-find-three-people aliens) and ends with different humans, notably a black soldier, being all heroic and saving our Lord Tom.This ties into another, niggly point: continuity. As has already been pointed out on this website, Spielberg somehow fails to remember that his electrical storm ought to destroy various electrical equipment such as digital cameras (most importantly with the journalist who shows Cruise one of the aliens landing in his/her/its giant tripod). Similarly: when Cruise's prison is dropped by the tripod he destroys with grenades no human inside is even remotely hurt, despite the fact that the impact destroys the metal shell enough to crack it open. Most annoyingly: a person, who was a very annoying character much deserving of death in my opinion, rushes headlong into a suicidal battle only to turn up safe and sound later on. On top of all this, Boston is apparently too irrelevant a metropolis to warrant destruction by alien invaders.Finally the last awkward detail: why would aliens capable of burying vast, mechanical behemoths many years ago deep in the ground of our fair planet so that they can take over many years later (a time line the patronising narrator tells us) bother going to all that trouble when they could've just got set up when they came to put said machines down in the first place!?! And why weren't they destroyed by the same bacteria that did for them when they returned? Oh and bacteria aren't the smallest organisms on the planet.This has been a long tirade of negativity but War of the Worlds is still, despite my rating, worth a look. It's long, poorly thought out and recklessly indulgent of its director's desire to be different. On the other hand it is a Spielberg film and does have many of his high quality trademarks: film making flare, visual understanding, extreme tension building, a John Williams score, an actor being an unexpectedly human hero and other such things.However, by comparison to much of his other work, it falls way short. A lot was made in the pre-release notes about how quickly this film was made, some (Spielberg himself) suggesting that the whole thing was a crazy proposition. It seems to me that he was a lot closer to that mark than intended and the film sorely needed some re-scripts and re-shoots to cover up some disappointing continuity and pacing problems.Still, compared to Star Wars episode three, not to mention the not-so-Fantastic Four, it ranks as one of the better blockbusters this summer. Unfortunately, it seems that the best Hollywood has come up with recently falls way short of what went before. Over the next few years we may well see the Summer Blockbuster becoming the Christmas Art-house Classic as the balance of power shifts to a younger breed of talented directors... all I can say is roll up King Kong!",

I have a feeling that the events that happened in this movie will happen someday in the far/near future!!! Those who are into Sci-Fi films should definitely see this thrilling movie. You should see this movie while it's still in the theater, because the bigger and louder the film is the better it is!!! Again to the people who seen and disliked the movie, I suggest you go see it again, and pay attention this time.",

I was impressed by the destruction and the portrayal of the rampage of the aliens on the earth. Some plot twists were gnawing at me, however I dismissed them as minor and forgivable.Then came the ending. The ending which took around 2 minutes to unfold and did not do what endings are designed for. Completing the plot. The story basically ended with a rubbish explanation that seemed to have been shot in 1 afternoon as an afterthought.So what does that leave? Nothing. No plot = no movie in my book. I have in fact lost my will to live and function when movies like this get made and people in their millions spend their hard earned cash to see.Shame on yee Spillberg, you have unleashed this on the world.

It was pretty difficult to forget earlier version so it had to be mix of old and new elements.I think it is great composition. Tom is great (I would like to add as usual) but also the other characters are very solid! Robins is really good! No matter what your friends may say about this movie it is more than worth to be seen! Also sound effects are impressive.Whole atmosphere in the movie is very dark and pessimistic as it would be so we may feel feelings of main characters.Spielberg shows us once again that he is real genius for such spectacular movies.I hope there will be more sf movies from his \"laboratory\" soon!",

What was most impressive to me was the awfully dark climate, and the atmosphere gave me the strong feeling of an inevitable catastrophe, along with the wonderful and thrilling acting by Tom Cruise. I think that the main message of this film is not the end, a bit easy certainly, but the fact that a new life can easily replace the human life. I am quite receptive to this vision that life does not need humanity to go on, and this wonderful picture of blood-red landscapes shown in the movie mean nothing less than \"life goes on... but without humans\". Pay attention to the music Williams made at the end of the movie: is this a truly \"happy end\"? I suppose Spielberg made this end so unreal that no one can truly believe in it: the picture is not about a human victory, for once. This is one of its great qualities.",

The city the Tom Cruise (Nowhere, New Jersey) had lost all power (watches, cars and everything), yet when the aliens starting kicking butt and taking names there were still cameras and video cameras working. MAJOR HOLE! Spielberg should be ashamed for that.2. Tom Cruise's son...why was he in the movie again? Why did he want to see the army losing to the aliens? And how did he make it to Boston in the end? Pointless character.3. Tom Cruise v. Tim Robbins - sorry, but my money is on the crazy 6 ft plus maniac. Although the determined father could draw super strength from his daughter I suppose. I could let that one slide.4. And MOST IMPORTANTLY every major city in the world has been razed. Last time I checked Boston was a major city. You mean to tell me that not only was that one neighborhood in all of Boston was not touched by the aliens but EVERYONE would emerged from the house looking no worse for the wear? They looked fabulous and the freakin' house was still intact. Not only was everybody home, clean and looking FABULOUS, but they simply looked as if they ate bad pork or something. Sorry Spielberg (and I'm a fan) but that was WACK!! At least have the house destroyed and a couple of people in bandages cleaning through the ruins, that would've been more meaningful. AND THE BOY MYSTERIOUSLY EMERGING....WEAK, WEAK WEAK! But I have to say for Boston that that was one hell of a curse that was lifted to barely be touched in that neighborhood.

Most of the suspense in the movie is generated through the erratic behaviour of Tom Cruise's two kids. They behave as one would expect from any average action movie who runs out of steam: The kids are hysterical, spoiled and try to run away in obvious danger situations at any given moment (At least this explains why Tom Cruise is divorced).If you like the average Tom Cruise movie (Top Gun, Cocktail, Born on the 4th of July, etc.), you'll be very happy with this movie.However, I was looking for a Spielberg movie, and I was very very very disappointed.

(aside from \"Star Wars Ep.III\"), judging by the intensity of its advertising and the fact the ads invited people to buy tickets in advance in order to ensure seats. Accidentally I watched the movie the night before the premiere and there wasn't more than 20 people in the cinema. So much for power of advertising.Nevertheless, every new movie Spielberg comes up with draws deserved attention, if anything because we are sure to be treated with at least an innovation or two, packed in a carefully designed production. And that's more than can be said for majority of movies these days.This movie also brings certain innovations, regarding mostly the story. The story is an adaptation of H.G.Welles' novel and, despite its resemblance to \"Independence day\", is in fact the original one. There is also an alien race attacking the Earth in our time and here's where the similarity ends. Instead of the point of government or military circles this movie takes the point of an ordinary man to tell the tale of war. He's doing his best to survive and save his family while observing the chaos around him and is no better or worse at it than the humanity in repulsing the aliens. Eventually it turns out that this isn't even our war. Nobody has a clue what's going on, how the aliens came and what do they want. That's why we are denied the proper explanation of the events through the usual means of educated characters. That way an atmosphere of chaos and hopelessness is successfully achieved. Only a narrator at the end tells us that the earth viruses won the war for us.The focus on the main character is so strong and important that we never separate from him through the entire movie. We observe him observing the war. This leads to another innovation which is: detracting from the special effects. They ARE abundant and they ARE top notch (as always with Spielberg), but this time they serve as mere backdrop to the turmoils of the main character. That is, special effects finally serve the story and not vice versa.While these innovations are all positive it must be noted that there are still many typical Hollywood (or Spilbergian) clich\u00e9s and implausibilities which prevent this movie for being truly unforgettable experience. I do, however, recommend it on the grounds of innovations and visual appeal.",

Granted there are a couple of places where it seemed Spielberg must have been drinking heavily before filming, such as was the way the story went, but overall it is very very respective of the 1939 radio version. I am intimately familiar with all versions of this work and this is one of the best I have seen. I am not a Tom Cruise fan, but I give him his props for this one. He played the role very well and very convincingly. And the choice for the narrator will knock you off your seat!But having read some of the other comments submitted herein, I am realizing that this was a waste of time and celluloid. People are apparently missing the point of this movie very widely. This is a movie version of the 1939 radio play. Not of the novel or the 1953 movie.

This is a character and film with a lot of hate. Some consider Bickle to be a loner, but sometimes he appears to be a man with a lot hatred to his surroundings. Could it be a political or social statement by Scorsese? Or perhaps that Paul Schrader was going through depression when he wrote the script? Whatever the answer might be, all I can say is that this is a very powerful film. If you are like me when this film is over your mouth will be wide open. Bickle (in a perfect performance by Robert De Niro) is a scary character. Although his motives are positive (sometimes) the way he gets results is a little extreme. Then again it was the '70s. I'm sure there's a lot of Travis Bickles out there.

That is not at all what this movie is about. This movie is about the power of the human psyche, and how fragile it can be. The development of the main character, Travis Bickle, throughout this movie follows the transformation of his mind and shows how certain events can shape one's mind and lead a person to things unimaginable. An important film, and a must see.p.s. I believe this movie, in a way, to be the follow-up of another great De Niro film, \"The Deer Hunter.\" Seeing as how De Niro's character is a Vietnam war vet, you could use his character in the Deer Hunter as the background for Travis Bickle, and it would help to explain a lot in this film.",

I rented Taxi Driver with some friends seventeen years after its theatrical release.I was blown away. My friends and I didn't say a word until ten minutes after it was over. How was it that a movie like this could have such an impact?The film stars Robert DeNiro as Travis Bickle who takes on a taxi career after serving in the Marines in Vietnam and suffering from some horrible discharge. From the beginning we already feel something unpleasant about Travis. We can see that he's lonely, reserved and a bit socially awkward. We sense something more intense underneath but we don't really know what it is. Wandering into porn movie theaters makes him seem even more lonely and perverted. This is his quality time after long days of witnessing a violent atmosphere of pimps, prostitutes and homeless drug addicts.Taxi life sure isn't the solution to his miserable and solitary life. Bur one day, Travis spots a girl played by Cybil Shepard who works at a campaign headquarter for a presidential candidate. We watch Travis trying to flirt and ask her out and although it seems charming to an average bimbo, it comes across as totally awkward. There are long pauses of silence and observations that sound creepily insulting. \"I can see the way you carry yourself that you're not a happy person\" he says. When he takes her out to lunch, we see Travis's loneliness amplified with a a mild sense of paranoia. This scene is utterly ironic in how we see a typical first date as sounding nervous and alienating. Who is this guy? Cybil seems intrigued by him and is reminded of a Kris Kristoferssen song: \"he's a poet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction.\" It's a great description of Travis but he immediately gets insulted. Rather then analyze the song, he just gets defensive.\" \"I'm not a pusher and I never have pushed.\" He proves himself wrong. After a bad date of trying to take her to a porno movie, he can't take \"no\" for an answer. We start to see more of Travis's creepy personality unfold as he obsesses over her by sending flowers and finally bursting in the office to yell and scream at her. Why does'nt he get it? After all the drunks, weirdos and psychos he picks up, could'nt he learn something ? No, instead, he is driven to a plan of madness. We don' know exactly what but its definitely building inside him. We see this in an amazing scene with Peter Boyle outside a cafeteria. Their interaction reinforces the loneliness and alienation between these characters. Its a quiet scene but its so true in its portrayal that it seem scary. The film looks like a documentary at times because we see street action in the background that weaves in and out of the foreground giving you a sense of real life drama. Some of the shots are particularly shocking and so matter of fact. When an encounter with a pimp turns bloody, we see it from a distance as if we were pedestrians witnessing a crime. The violence in this film is anything but glorified. It puts the film in a gritty and dirty atmosphere that we don't want to participate in. But its not just the violence that hooks us in, its the bizarre and psychological mysteries that carry the story. How did Travis get infatuated with Cybil Shepard? Was it coincidence that she worked for the presidential nominee? How events happen and get traced in this film is utterly disturbing. I still can't explain how a film could have an impact to the magnitude that it did. One thing I do know is the director (Martin Scorsese), the screenwriter (Paul Schrader) and the main actor (Robert DeNiro) were all going through similar experiences during the making of this film. That is rare in a field that involves a lot collaboration. When it does happen it as it did, it becomes truly magical. This is without a doubt, Scorsese's best film to date.",

The movie shows the decay of the inner boroughs of Manhattan and the decline of a disturbed individual's mind. A former Viet-Nam vet turned cab driver (Robert De Niro) is roaming the streets watching the world go to pot. The line between fantasy and reality is ever blurring because of his mental status. Slowly over time he imagines that society needs someone who will clean the streets and get rid of the vermin that runs rampant. After having a falling out at an attempt to have a normal relationship with a w.a.s.p.y woman (Cybil Shepard), he decides to become a young prostitute's savior (Jodie Foster) and bump off her sleazy pimp (Harvey Keitel). After trying to impress his ex-girlfriend by nearly killing her political employer, the cabbie decides to go out in a blaze of glory whilst confronting the pimp and the prostitute's client in a nearby flop house. Instead of being locked up in a loony bin, he's proclaimed a hero.A strange film from Scorsese. It was made during the last phase of his innovative career. After this film, he went on to direct more subtle fair. Paul Schrader would become Hollywood's next wunderkind and have a brilliant (but short) career himself. Even today, this movie is still rife with controversy. The inflammatory racial content and views of mental illness still ruffle people's feathers.Highly recommended!",

But then, these two are in fact very different types of vigilante. Kersey's action is driven by a personal tragedy and it's very clear in his mind what he is doing. Bickle, as one critic puts it, is \"certifiably insane\". But then, he is also clear about what he is doing, but in a different way.I can't remember who said that the mind of a mad man is just like the mind of a child (maybe nobody said it). When Bickle, after winning a favorable reaction from his blond goddess Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), blunders by taking her to a porn movie, his apology is as sincere as a 10-year-old boy's who has accidentally broken a neighbor's window with a baseball. This one layer of Bickle's mind, this innocence, is always there, even when it is subordinated to his absolute detestation of the \"scum\" of New York that finally drives him to become a psychotic. So much have been said about the urban alienation, the inability to relate etc, etc, of this character. The deepest impression in my mind from De Niro's portrayal, however, is his childlike innocence.",

It turns into a nightmare.His isolation is complete. His pride makes it impossible to return to his parents and his less than basic understanding of human interaction makes him an absolute outsider.At work, colleagues are cordial but distant and there is no family, friends or love for him. Unfortunately, Travis, though uneducated and lacking in understanding the problem, is not stupid. He understands what's happening and starts to see society as the enemy. Society is a hostile environment that wants him out and threats him like a monster.Travis personalization of one man against the world starts to turn ugly when he sees the 'filth' on the street. His job takes him to the less than savory nightlife on the streets. He really resents this. Why can hookers, drug-addicts, sellers and the 'scum' have a life, be part of it, while he can't ?When hope turns up into the form of Betsy and is subsequently drown by his misunderstanding/self-destructive nature, the descend into madness quickens. Yet, he needs to fabricate a reason and killing Palantine (for the treason of Betsy) or the rescue of a clearly underage hooker Iris) will do.After the inevitable violence, the ending is one of the best I've ever encountered. It can be taken two ways. It could be Travis' last moments of hope in which he believes he's made a hero for cleaning up the filth, forgives Betsy and receives thanks for giving Iris a better future. But likewise, it could be that Travis actually survived and this would make the ending a warning and a ironic look at society, itself a disturbed creature.Schrader, Scorsese and Deniro at the top of their power, supported by a brilliant score from Bernard Hermann. The whole movie is shot from Travis point of view and Deniro carries the picture effortlessly. Betsy and Iris both do what they're expected to do but cameo's of Harris as Palantine and Brooks as Betsy's coworker also deserve a mention. The only ones that seem a bit intrusive are Boyle and Keitel. But there's really nothing to complain about.Important, better than perfect (which only means there's nothing wrong with it). If you care about people, there's nothing trite or repulsive in here.

The movie moves at a leisurely pace highlighting the mundane and repetitive aspect of a taxi driver's life and gives you enough time to get into the skin of the characters and experience what they are going through.Although 'are you talking to me' is the most famous scene of the movie but I can never forget the scene in which De Niro starts rocking the TV set by his foot and then just lets it fall and crash.

However i saw it recently (having established faith in director Martin Scorsese) and was amazed by it.The most amazing is the role of Travis Bickle played by Robert De Niro in the fairly early flushes of his up and down acting career. De Niro at this point in his life ever the perfectionist (method acting et al), becomes the character he is portraying, a confused, insomniac ex Vietnam soldier who works as a taxi driver.All around him he sees a sleazy New York from his taxi and examines it through the eyes of someone who thinks that he can do something about it. The whole of the film is himself building up to doing something about cleaning the streets of the filth and scum that have enraged him. In between all this, Travis is shown as someone who fails to understand other people. He manages to get a date with the Cybill Shepherd character Betsy but takes her to a porn movie, yet he cant understand why she is offended. After that he is seen considering and toying with his mind what to do after Betsy doesn't want to know him, and the idea of killing a potential Senator (Charles Palantine, played conservatively by Leonard Harris) who Betsy supports. Almost goes through with this but doesn't.The short scenes he has with Jodie Foster who plays underage prostitute Iris, are very interesting, a typical almost father to daughter chat of Travis to Iris. It is the conversations he has with her that leads him to try and rid her of her pimp Sport played by Harvey Keitel in a small but vital role.The major shootout between Travis and the 'scum' he sees in an apartment where Iris is fairly tame by todays standards but at the end of the film when he has been shot a few times himself he mimics putting a gun at his head and pulling a trigger, to which then fades to newspaper cuttings about him being a local hero, which then fades to him being back in his taxi and driving Betsy somewhere.A lot has been said about the ending, i don't know the official word on it but i believe after the shoot out near the end the rest of it is played out in Travis's own mind before he dies from his injuries.A classic film, very dark in content, and worth viewing a few times before either dismissing it or loving it.",

As different series of events unfold he becomes more unstable and has the urge to lash out at a society that has gone down the sewer.Taxi Driver is a superb piece of cinema.

She delivers a great, heart-wrenching performance. We really feel for her character and all that she has gone through. Harvey Keitel does a great job as the PIMP Sonny. The audience doesn't like him one bit and that's thanks to Keitels great performance.DeNiro delivers a truly great performance. Even though Travis is a lonely, violent, unstable cabbie we do feel sympathy for him and we almost cheer him on.Scorsese has done a fabulous job of directing and the score by Bernard Herrmann is absolutely terrific. The dialogue is great and thought provoking and the cinematography is brilliant.

It proved to be a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy when, less than five years after it was filmed, a loner shot the US president to impress an actress who had appeared in this film. The implications of this are a little frightening when you think about it\u0085 Robert De Niro is scarily convincing as Travis Bickle, a nondescript Vietnam vet who observes the dissolution on the streets of New York from the isolation of his cab. Each night he drives the streets, witnessing a tide of depravity that spills into the back of his cab, and each morning, after his shift, he has to wipe from the back seat the results of those intrusions. That's a bad enough experience for any man, but Travis is a loner who longs for a normal life and relationships but is too inarticulate and confused to be able to obtain them. He ruins his chance with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), campaign worker for a senator seeking election, by taking her to a porn film on their first date, and is genuinely confused when she takes exception to such behaviour. As Bickle tries to win her back on a public phone, his face hidden from the viewer, the camera pans away from him to focus on a corridor leading to the street as if embarrassed for him, and from then on, as his descent into madness gathers pace, Travis seems to edge further toward the edge of the screen in almost every shot.Bernard Herrmann's score superbly captures both the sleazy side of the New York streets and the sense of foreboding that permeates the entire film. Scorsese guides us through Bickle's increasingly disturbed state of mind without resorting to sensationalism or cheap manipulation of the audience, and Paul Schrader's intelligent script creates a completely believable character in Bickle as an unremarkable everyman who shares our standards of what's right and wrong but with a skewed perspective that has turned him into a ticking time-bomb. Only the speed with which Bickle and Iris develop a relationship and the contentious ending, for which too many people try to find a hidden meaning, weakens the film overall. That ending just doesn't sit right with the rest of the film \u0096 and Scorsese himself has discounted theories that it may be a dream sequence \u0096 but that shouldn't dissuade anyone with an interest in intelligent, thought-provoking films to catch this one at least once.",

The meeting with a baby prostitute and the will of rescuing her will give him a new aim.The movie is dramatic and passionate. It's a story of an anti-hero who wants to save another anti-heroin. Also when he tries to court another woman (Cybill Shepherd) the result is a complete disaster (look at the scenes...!), it's impossible for him to enter a \"normal\" world. There's an anguish sense through all the movie, underlined by Bernard Herrman score. Definitely \"Taxi driver\" is the momentum of the \"nouvelle vague\" in Hollywood movies. Actually the Seventies were the only time when big studios really allowed independent directors to do their own films. Now these two worlds are more separated than before.This film won the \"Palme d'or\" at Cannes Film festival in 1976, and brought chance to Scorsese, Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and (of course) Robert De Niro -the same year he made Bernardo Bertolucci's \"Novecento\", the year before he won an Oscar for \"The Godfather part II\".",

Aside from watching Robert DeNiro in his first role, I thought there wasn't much to like in this movie --and I'm not just talking about the violence. The \"romance\" between DeNiro's character and Cybill Shepard's sleek young professional is improbable to the nth degree, and even a clueless shmuck like DeNiro wouldn't be stupid enough to take a high class girl to a porno film on his first date. I suppose the viewer is expected to infer the reasons for every other unexplained development in the movie: DeNiro's purchase of an arsenal of weapons larger than some U.S. units are equipped with in Iraq, his sudden urge to rescue Jodie Foster's child prostitute, the approach to the candidate for president (couldn't get close enough to kill him, I guess), the final scene driving Cybill Shepard's character in his taxi (a dream sequence while he's still in the hospital or after he's died?), the letter of thanks from the parents of the child prostitute (also a dream sequence? also after he's died?). Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn. As for the direction, if Scorcese hadn't done better work than this, he'd be an obscure footnote. I expected to like this movie a lot more than I did.",

I've always found the fact that DiNiro's character was an ex-Marine interesting especially because it is not emphasized at all in the movie. In many ways I think it is as much of an examination of the psyche of soldiers trained to kill as it is a look at loneliness. Just one of the greatest scripts I've ever seen and it is executed brilliantly. The camera work is ground breaking as well. Phenomenal film.

Its one of De Niro's best roles, his performance is so good that it sends shivers down my spine every time I see it. To anyone who hasn't seen the film, De Niro plays a character called Travis Bickle, a man who takes a job as a taxi driver having been discharged from the army. It is through this job that he becomes disillusioned by all the crime and \"filth\" he sees around him and decides to take matters into his own hands. He is a challenging and multi layered character that De Niro brings to life with huge success. He may be a very extreme depiction of loneliness but even so he still seems every bit as real as you or me, he is a likable character to whom most people will be able to relate. That's the real genius of De Niro's performance; he makes you believe in Bickle no matter what he does.It was an early film for Scorsese who has since gone on to become one of the top names in Hollywood, but I would still regard this as his very best work. The night scenes are unmatched for their dark and gritty atmosphere, and the sense of loneliness that you share with Bickle throughout the film is chilling no matter how many times you watch it. However, Scorsese and De Niro alone don't make this a great film, there's Paul Schrader's masterpiece of a script, the haunting Bernard Herrmann score, and the A-list cast, that all come tougher to make this a living classic. The 70's brought many greats, and this is one of them. If you haven't seen it yet you really need too, especially if you're a Scorsese or De Niro fan, it's a superb film and a great addition to any collection. Highly recommended.",

                "comment": "Somewhere in the shadows of the night, hidden within the restraints of his taxicab, a lonely man watches with disgust. His eyes survey the streets with all the malice and passion of a burning fire, his large pupils an open doorway leading into his soul. The demons haunt him; voices in his head convince him that the world is closing in and the only way out is through some form of moral redemption; a physical and emotional catharsis.The stranger's name is Travis Bickle and he is God's Lonely Man: a discharged Vietnam veteran who wanders the streets at night in a permanent state of confusion and self-loathing.Travis takes a job as a cab driver to keep out of the porn theaters that have been occupying his time \u0096 deciding he might as well get paid for roaming since he does it anyway.But Travis' filtered input and odd output seems to suggest something is dreadfully wrong. The mild insanity of our protagonist begins to escalate. He approaches an attractive political campaign adviser, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), and asks her out to dinner. She agrees, but the date is cut short when Travis takes her to an X-rated film.Travis soon meets a young underage prostitute named Iris (a fourteen-year-old Jodie Foster), whom he feels a desire \u0096 nay, a need -- to rescue from slavery. Iris' pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel), becomes another of Travis' demons.Taxi Driver was released in 1976 to split praise. Some critics hailed it as a masterpiece, whilst others were a great deal more reserved in their accolade. In Newsweek, Jack Kroll wrote \"(\u0085) in their eagerness to establish rich and moral ambiguities, the Catholic Scorsese and the Calvinist Schrader have flubbed their ending. It's meant to slay you with irony, but it's simply incredible.\" Some critics just hated the film in general and felt the entire runtime was a mess of pretentious storytelling and depressing, gritty themes.Depressing? Yes. Gritty? Yes. Brilliant? Most definitely. Scorsese does not merely address Travis as a character; he puts us inside his head. And even so, there are instances of abnormality in Scorsese's camera work that suggest paranoia and schizophrenia; moments of displaced subjectivity in which we are neither looking quite through the eyes of Travis nor through those around him, but more at length to his side\u0085yet it seems that his body (primarily his hands) are below us, at the side of the frame, indicating an altered version of the traditional P.O.V.Scorsese's movie is structured using diverse narrative elements \u0096 one of the most prominent being dramatic irony rooted in Greek tragedy (in this case, many set-up and pay-off moments). When Travis exits the brothel for the first time, a Mafioso figure says, \"Come back any time.\" Travis responds, \"I will.\" We know he will, too, and when he does, that's the pay-off.Above all else the film is rooted in the basic existentialism philosophies of Berdyaev, Heidegger and Nietzsche. Scorsese later admitted this his toying of genres and philosophy was entirely incidental (\"It just felt right\u0085\") but one can't help but imagine Schrader may have been influenced by Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground, in which our narrator begins, \"I am a sick man\u0085I am a spiteful man.\" This brings to mind the scene in which Bickle dictates his journal entries to us and delivers an ultimatum to the \"filth\" on the streets, preceded by senseless introspective rambling.Moving on, the ultimate puzzle of the film: Does our hero live or die? After Travis is shot in the climactic battle, he lies on a sofa, presumably dying, and makes a gesture with his fingers, pretending to shoot himself in the head. The camera pulls up, overhead, and exits the brothel. It then pulls back across the street and up into the heavens, surveying the crowd below.In the next scene, Travis is alive and well, presented to the world as a hero through the media. Yet as Travis pulls away from the curb at the end of the film, Herrman's familiar four notes (the same ones as used for the final shot of Psycho, implemented when Norman Bates' lack of absolute sanity is finally revealed) come into play. A bell rings. Travis looks in his rearview mirror, as if maybe something caught his eye\u0085 And then, suddenly, the movie ends.Taxi Driver's ending cannot be resolved further more than conjecture and opinion. Scorsese himself says on the DVD making-of documentary that he believes the ending is open for analysis. Did Travis live? Did he die? Are the demons on the street still haunting him? Are we meant to sympathize with him and believe he is a hero, or are we meant to refuse him as one? (Or is this our natural reaction against Scorsese's own wishes -- which would explain the negative reviews in '76?) But it is ultimately the haunting image of Bickle drifting through the endless hordes of nameless people on the streets of Manhattan that lingers with us after the film has ended, and remains the most prescient today. How effortlessly this man can disappear into the multitudes \u0096 God's Lonely Man once again alone, alienated and betrayed by the world he has come to loathe. That, above all else, is the most poignant aspect of Taxi Driver.",

Even though I don't know the feeling of living in a city which has a dark seedy--at least visible-- side I can say it is not a typical American flick. You do not see a hero who kills bad men and achieves something good in the world of wickedness! You do not see just action which may be pretty goony in any film. You do not see just philosophical inner monologues but you feel you are just involved the story of Travis. Travis is an alienated guy who tries to comes to grip with the socially disoriented world around himself. He suffers from insomnia and consequently takes a job as taxi driver and volunteers to work the overnight shift \"anytime, anywhere\". Travis spends his spare time watching pornography in seedy theaters and driving around aimlessly through the darkest and most repulsive neighborhoods of Manhattan.While he just drives through these detestable neighborhoods of the town we witness the seedy side of the town and we feel the struggle of a frustrated lonely guy against the cold and distant world. The only thing that the movie lacks is the ambiguity of its ending. Roger Ebert has written of the film's ending, \"There has been much discussion about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Travis's 'heroism', and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Scorsese's characters.\" I am not sure it is practically true either. In that way it reminded me Barton Fink which sounded like a sophisticated joke to me when it ended coz I had not figured out which part was fantasy which part was reality.

Walked down a street full of strangers, realising there is no-one around that you know? I'm sure most people have felt that sometime, but Travis Bickle takes that to the most extreme degree, he feels like that all the time. The man who bring this character to life happens to be the rather obsessive, meticulous, method actor, that is Robert Deniro. Travis is such a complex character, miles away from most two dimensional Hollywood blockbuster heroes, for Robert Deniro to bring him to life, well to me makes him one of the greatest movie actors. He doesn't have a \"catchphrase\", he doesn't have friends, basically all he has is his job and his own loneliness. So basically I would say that Travis is the ultimate anti-hero.I feel that anyone who has ever had a time in their life where they've spent a lot of alone time, maybe people who have simply seen a friend be like that, can relate. I think this is where the mass appeal lies. Another aspect is that Taxi Driver follows a real life murderer, he isn't portrayed as a monster though, just a misfit, who is a very real person.Finally, the film just has a certain touch of class. Just the intro scenes made enough of an impact on me. That music and the visuals of the taxi. The speech at the beginning already confirming that Taxi Driver is going to be one of the darkest films you've ever seen (all the animals come out at night). It's brutally honest about New York (at the time), it doesn't paint some sort of false picture about it. It's all there, the drugs, the prostitutes, the porno theatre. How many other films dare talk about these things? Even now? But guess what, though I've never been to New York, I could show you all of these things if I went down to London. Most places have this side to them.People understand this film. Whether they relate it to themselves or to someone they know, or simply find it interesting to watch Travis' descent until he finally cracks. The surroundings of a big city like New York, with a dirty underside, still relevant. All of these aspects, which I've discussed, make sure that the film is still watched and still relevant today. Sure it will be lost on some people who demand a much faster pace, people who are wondering when the killing will begin and even take joy in it when it does, but Taxi Driver is not supposed to be that film. It's a portrayal of emptiness, loneliness and alienation. People don't watch films like this, they become immersed in them.So in short; Great acting, great music, great visuals, great script.

It is the isolation of Travis which is a caveat of what the post-modern era will be, as the English philosopher Thomas Hobbs indicated; a society full of atomised individual's colliding with each other.Here De Nero's depiction of the atomised individual is played to almost perfection.
